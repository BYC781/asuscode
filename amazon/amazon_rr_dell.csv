I found a 2015 PCMag review of a Dell Optiplex 9020 with a MSRP of $989.00 8G or RAM and a 128G SSD drive.
The Dell Optiplex 9020 was originally sold with Windows 8.1 Pro installed but included the option to downgrade to Windows 7 Pro.
The BIOS has a 2019 date but I believe this was replaced along with the OS, RAM and SSD drive.
The Intel Core i7-4770 CPU was first released in 2014. It's a 4th. gen Intel chip and in 2023 we are up to the 13th gen. The Intel Core i7-4770 CPU is not on the list of acceptable CPUs for Windows 11 so the OS cannot be upgraded to Windows 11 and will loose Microsoft support in October of 2025 in only a couple of years.
I believe this PC was originally sold 5 to 9 years ago before substantial upgrades that were part of making it an Amazon Renewed PC in 2023.

I shrunk the Windows 10 partition and made the PC a Dual Boot Machine that will primarily run the latest version of Linux Mint which I believe will support this older CPU for years.

It came with a VGA port two DisplayPort connectors and a DiplayPort to HDMI adapter and can drive three displays at once.

I did not use the keyboard and mouse that came with the computer as I was replacing a computer connected to a KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) switch.

I have found no defect so far and the case looked new when I opened the box. Although I know the case and CPU are old and windows tells me it can't be upgraded to Windows 11 I am really happy with this purchase.",38,樣式: Intel Core i7-4770 | 無光學

The setting wasn't easy as windows was locked and asking for Walmart email or security key. I have a laptop running on dual OS (Linux and Windows 11). I erased Windows with the Walmart credentials nonsense from the refurbished Dell drive by installing Linux using a bootable USB. Downloaded Windows 10 Pro and created a bootable USB using my laptop's Windows 11 (it's hard to create Windows 10 or 11 bootable USB using Linux. I get files larger than 4GB error).
I reinstalled Windows 10 Pro using the bootable USB and removed Linux. Trying to install Windows from USB while the desktop still has the Walmart locked Windows wasn't working. That's why I used linux to override that mess and go back to remove Linux.

The HD audio output by-amped to my full sized Altec Lansing speakers is excellent also. I've spent a few days checking it out and everything functions correctly, and the system is very quick.
I bought this because my old computer finally up and died on me and like a bad boy it wasn't backed up.

It had a link that took me to the drivers. I ended up not needing to use them, but it was a nice gesture.

The computer comes with:
- Wifi USB dongle
- Bluetooth USB dongle
- AC power cord
- Display Port to HDMI adaptor (computer only has Display Port slots)
- Corded Mouse (low quality but useable)
- Corded Keyboard (low quality, but better than the mouse)
- Paperwork that explains that Windows 10 is a OEM volume install so it comes pre-activated.

The outer housing of the computer was in almost new condition. The only flaws noticeable were a couple small scratches on the silver Dell logo area.
It started right up and booted into Windows without a problem. It took me moving the Wifi dongle to another USB port to get a connection, but that was the only problem I ran into. Since then, the computer and connection are stable and strong.
The graphics are good for business and video/internet duty. You can play older games, but the GPU isn't made for gaming so don't buy this computer for a kid who wants to game unless they like vintage gaming.
I like the computer and knew the limitations before I purchased it. It's a big step up from my old laptop and the only real downside (which I knew before buying it) was that it's not Windows 11 upgradable.",44,樣式: Intel Core i7-4770 | 無光學

The computer looks new inside and out.
The pros are dual monitor support (critical for my use), it's fast, it has plenty of ram and the 1tb SSD rocks. The cons are no bluetooth dongle included (no biggie), not upgradable to win11 (win10 EOL is 2025), and the WIFI dongle.. while it works, isn't the best.

I spent another 25$ on a decent WIFI card and bluetooth dongle and everything works like it should and WIFI signal is great. I already had a nice wireless mouse and keyboard. The included units are very basic and wired.

Oh and not that it matters anymore but the DVD is read only, no burner.

Oh, and for what ever original reason they had, mine had both serial and parallel cards added.

I chunked one of them to make room for the WIFI card.

I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting an inexpensive work station.

Edit to add, this is the wifi card I used (sourced from Amazon)

TP-Link AC1200 PCIe WiFi Card(Archer T4E)- 2.4G/5G Dual Band Wireless PCI Express Adapter

This is a holiday present. Today, December 27th, I began the set up. There was no real documentation in hand, just follow the instructions as they appeared on screen. I attempted to install a software program using a CD. However, the CD/DVD/R drive does not work. It would come on momentarily then shut down. I had to use a bent paper clip to open the drive to retrieve my installation disc. I called the company's tech hotline for help in the morning, and they called back in the afternoon the same day. They said the drive is defective and gave me a choice of either sending me a replacement drive that I would install, or they would exchange the computer for a different one. The fastest way is to have them send me a replacement drive, but this still will take approximately two weeks because, as I was informed, it is the holidays. Could be also that the company is located in Ontario, and I am in the US. He said he had no way to expedite. So back to the old computer for now. This is my first refurbished product from Amazon, and I am not impressed or satisfied at this point. I'll try the replacement drive because it is the quickest but still a two week wait. It could be that I may ultimately sent back for a refund. One other point, both the mouse and the keyboard have short cords so these will need to be replaced as they will not reach the back of the computer when placed on the desk. Will update review later.

Update 12/30/22: I decided to return the unit for a refund. This was described as fully functional and in excellent condition, but the DVD/R drive did not work. I should not be expected to install the replacement. It could be that the computer's bios did not recognize the drive. Who knows? Also, as mentioned earlier, the keyboard and mouse cords were too short and did not reach the back of the computer on my desk. Now I have to replace them? I lost confidence in the product; if the drive did not work out of the box, then what else will fail? Amazon was true to their word and is processing the return that I sent back via their UPS return label. I did have to pack it up though (I saved the original shipping carton that it came in).",3,樣式: Intel Core i7-4770 | 無光學

The computer has been perfect until 1-21-2023, since Feb 2022. I think the mother board has failed. I didn't purchase SERVICE PLAN. I have sent a request for a mother board per my own Troubleshooting. We will see how that goes. So far so good, EXCEPT the failure. Price was VERY GOOD for all this machine does. I need it for work. Hoping a mother board or replacement chassis can be sourced quickly for a reasonable price.

I purchased this system to try and get reasonable response times to my few demanding requests. No games.
But, I did get a Samsung dual port 4K curved monitor. I run an Fire-stick in the HDMI port using a DP to HDMI cable and this computer in the Display Port using a DP to DP cable. Both 4K. All of it works good. on the computer using streaming apps, I can watch 4 or 4 streams at once. Using the spoit screen, I can see a movie, show, or youtube. If i choose the split screen, i can watch all simultaneously. Kinda weird but it works. I just have to select which to LISTEN to!!
‘I can have open unlimited tabs on 3 or 4 browsers with no impact except getting lost in a cloud of tabs and browsers.
This machine does everything I wanted and more as the DVD works fine and it wan’t even referenced in the add.
I can close out or sign off all of them in less than 20 seconds. I can sign off and restart including sign on to user again all within 1 min and 4 seconds.
Actually a bit unbelievable to tell you the truth.

I only wish I could have had the OPTION to add a multiple port low profile PCIe USB 3 and C card within the order.
Zero complaints.

Not comfortable with that.

The HDMI to display port adapter seems to be working fine too.

The PC is SUPER quiet and it boots very fast, I am very happy with the purchase.

I already setup my network share with my other computers and everything is awesome.

See below.

I didn't read the specs carefully enough. This does not have an Ethernet jack to plug into the internet. I was able to order an adapter to plug the Ethernet cable into a USB port. I could have ordered the dock, but that would have added an extra $250 and at that price I should have just bought the upgraded version.

The cheaper models of Dell have a known issue where the hinge on the monitor breaks. The screws come loose and if you are not watching, it will damage the plastic around the monitor. I leave my computer on a desk. When I do travel with it, I carry it in a padded laptop case. After 5 months of gentle use, this should not be a problem. I'm shipping it off to Dell for a repair. Technically I'm still under Basic warranty but we know they will still charge me for it. There is a long list of these complaints on the Dell support site about this and the company is not doing anything about it.",4,

Not that I wanted one, but Microsoft makes one buy one with Windows 11: I began having issues with my Windows 10 laptop since Windows 11 was announced. 1st, thanks to a local delivery company, delivery was very late on this laptop. Very late and when calling them, they had no idea what was going on. When we contacted Off--- --x, they had no idea what was going on either and didn’t even care. In fact, if we didn’t phone the delivery company, it would never have been delivered. O----- --x was no help in tracking or getting this laptop to us. Shame on O---- --x. A helpful supervisor did take the time to give us a credit but couldn’t do anything else.
I do love the speed of the laptop. It is quite fast. The speakers are lousy. Even on highest level, it is low and tinny. Horrible for a laptop like this. I have two older laptops that have better speakers. However, the biggest con with this laptop is its lack of durability and reliability. Within just 3-1/2 months of use, the touchpad and mouse failed. Can't use it. Through remote testing Dell made the diagnosis that it failed and informed me that they would send me a replacement per the warranty. I am to send the broken one back or have to pay for it. After waiting a week, I checked on Dell.com to find out the status. No status showed and all I could find was, ""Resolution Pending"". What does that mean? I have no idea. Just how long am I supposed to wait to get a replacement part? I can’t use the laptop without it. I don’t like the touchscreen. I would think under warranty the replacement part would have been shipped out directly. No need to say how very disappointed I am in this purchase. The price at the time I purchased in in late February 2022 seemed reasonable. After this, all I can say that it was and is now still overpriced. Save your money and purchase another brand. And I miss having a CD/DVD recorder/player. As with everything else, size shrinks and prices go up. Overall, this purchase was a big nightmare: from the lousy shipping company; Do----- shipping of Jackson, MS to the failed touchpad/mouse, and lack of efficient warranty service and response. I'm not pleased at all. Sorry, but I can’t recommend this pc at all. I guess I should have listed to the rest of the negative reviews at Off----ax.",0,

I had to return the initial computer. The screen was broken and it came badly packaged (loose in bubble wrap). The return was easy. Second PC came in a smaller box with specialized and well made packaging. It ran well out of the box, but there are two almost necessary upgrades you'll need to make this usable for use.
1. SSD. this comes with an HHD but adding an SSD was easy. I'd never even seen the inside of a computer before and did it in 5 mins. you'll need an SSD, SATA data cable, and SATA power splitter. This cost me $30 on Amazon and made many games playable and the computer much faster.
2. better wifi USB. a $10 on Amazon boosted my speed x10+ up to ~200mbps (which is good considering how far my office is from the router)

The monitor is crap. The speakers look like toys. The key board is attached by wire to the mouse. Fortunately Grampy's keyboard and monitor are great so we just kept the junky stuff in a box as back ups and plugged in the boxy computer to everything. Works pretty good for a refurbished office computer. Can't beat the price. It does require manual connection to a modem so make sure you have an ethernet chord.

It was great for work. Minecraft lagged badly in Java but once I switched to the windows/bedrock version it played smoother. Valorant seemed to play good but I don’t have great internet so it’s hard to tell & the PC would occasionally crash mid game leading to afk offenses. One thing to note is that the monitor it came with was a wall monitor, I knew there was variations to what monitor you could get but there was no info about it possibly being a wall monitor. It was actually kind of nice for me but if you live in a place that can’t have a wall monitor keep in mind it’s possible for it to come with one that only works on the wall.
The very bad:
As mentioned before it would occasionally crash completely powering down but it would always boot back up and work fine after. About 6 months after I got it the pc crashed mid use, I went to turn it back on and it popped up with a screen saying the PC needed to be recovered with a special disk. I looked up the error code and saw that sometimes that is caused by a usb or power cord not being properly connected and to unplug all cords and check their connection. I did this and In doing this found that the power cord (sent with the computer originally) had melted. For background I only use the computer 4-6 hours at max in a day and had only had the computer on for about an hour when this happened so if I was using this full time for work instead of just occasional projects I don’t know how this pc would have held up. I reached out to the pc seller and after about a week of trying to get in contact (calling and them never picking up or calling me back, them insisting on calling me and then not) they told me to simply pick up a new standard 3 prong power cord. I was obviously worried that there was a bigger issue that would lead to the pc melting a cord but did what they said. They didn’t tell me any other details like what voltage requirements it needed so I looked around and got one that matched the voltage that most on the market are, that didn’t work. I looked at the original cord and it had a different requirement and after scouring the web found one that matched it and tried it however that didn’t work either with the computer only having a flashing orange power light/nothing on screen/and the fan running loud. I then reached out to the seller again and told them this and they said to take it to a local computer repair person because my warranty had ended. Luckily I had gotten the extra asurion protection plan. I called their tech support and they told me that this usually means that the power supply unit has failed and I would need to file a claim to get a refund. I’m glad I got the protection plan but this means packing up a pc, monitor, keyboard, and mouse and shipping it to asurion in order to get an Amazon gift card refund.
Bottom line I’m in shock that in only 6 months of owning this pc the power supply unit failed and on top of that the customer support was incredibly lacking once I did experience issues.",16,

Everyone has different thoughts on reviews until you buy it. I never do reviews but I have to. I bought three of these computers for my kids for Christmas. I got them early December so I was able to see what they were about. Clearly they are refurbished and if not then they are not taken care of in their wear-house. The first one I opened the PC tower was dented and rusted and looked like garbage. It was kinda depressing. The best part is their customer service they do replace the item really quick but while you are doing your return on the phone they will ask you to do a 5 star review so they can look good. I give their customer service 5 stars they are great but I will not do a review before I get my items next time. That was the first computer return. A week before Christmas I set them up for a surprise for the kids. As I turned them on one of the monitor was messed up and had lines running through the monitor. I had to submit a photo of the monitor to prove the monitor was messed up. The bad part was, one of my kids had to wait til the new monitor came to use it. I now just received the new monitor tonight, 12/26/2022. I connected the monitor and guess what there are the lines again running through the screen. Second screen same issues. Like I said I give it a 2 star rating because it was a great price, bad product, great customer service, bad gift for Christmas surprise because you don’t know if it will work for the kids. But…… I do have to say, the kids do love them, great for a first computer and for the issue with my one son’s monitor, I’m not even going to waste my time with it anymore. It’s more frustrating then anything. He is using my Samsung monitor for now and it’s working wonderful for him. So for anyone who buys it leave a review and I want to see if I’m the only one with issues.",39,

I only had the computer for a month EXACTLY before it started running slow and stuff so thankfully I'm computer savvy more than the average person and i ran a diagnostic test on mine and i needed an updated graphics card and guess what. A NEW HARD DRIVE!!! This was a super easy task but this was irritating. As soon as you get this computer make a recovery USB asap. You will need likely need it. (You should make one anyways). My hard drive went to trash within the month and a quick replace (got one from Amazon) and I uploaded my recovery USB and i fixed it myself. No problems since, I run heavy programs from time to time like Steam, adobe, i have multiple windows open etc. Once i fixed the hard drive I was good but I'll probably update it some more with new fans and such. If you want a skeleton to build on this is a cool computer. If you need a working computer this is fine for simple stuff too(until it gives you issues).

Tech support was a little irritating because all the tests I ran they asked me to do again and they woulda sent me a new hard drive but they're 50 bucks and i upgraded my space to 2Tb soooooooo yeah.

Overall it's okay. Knocked off two stars because my hard drive and my graphics card needed to be replaced within the month.
The computer itself is 8 years old, as long as the motherboard works you can fix it and upgrade as much as you like.",57,

Old computer & bought a much better rebuilt computer from Amazon which included keyboard, screen, mouse & speakers. The cost was only about $200 & included shipping & 90-day guarantee. New, this unit would likely cost $1,000 or more. Anyhow, when setting up the new computer, I ran into a fan problem. I immediately called customer service & after some discussion & sending of photos, they confirmed the fan had likely failed. I had already spent hours on transferring my old computer programs, files & contents to the new computer, so I didn’t want to send the whole thing back. So, customer service technicians suggested I consider installing new fan myself if I felt comfortable. They said it was fairly easy & sent video to help me out. They also reiterated that if I couldn’t handle putting in the new fan, I could still exercise 90-day guarantee. Well, since I’m not too handy, I damaged the fan trying to put it in. No problem says customer service. We’ll ship you what you need to replace it. And they did & I did. Very proud of myself, but couldn’t have done it without customer service support & follow-through.

The case is a little beat up..
Also the ports do not match the picture.. It's suppose to have 2 display ports, it only has one.

Keyboard and mouse are ridiculously cheap pieces of plastic that don't function very well and would recommend replacing them with 8-10$ ones from Walmart (or amazon probably.)
As far as using this for gaming, it caps out at 60 frames per second so as long as you don't mind that, I am able to play League of Legends with 40-60 frames. Didn't expect much more from such a cheap computer, but it does the job. It also came with little USB speakers that are kinda cool, but again, you can find much better ones for a decent price on amazon if that is important to you.

I filed a return claim within the allotted time frame on Thursday, January 05, 2023 and they refused to honor their own policy. When I was able to reach them via phone on Monday (they are closed on the weekend) had a family funeral on Friday, January 06, 2023, I was told I missed my return window by two days. The fact that I started a return online prior to the two day expiration did not matter to this company. The reason for calling was to acquire a free return label that they indicated on their return form. They indicated the importance of customer honesty, meaning I should not click on defective item etc. to get a free return label if the item was in fact not defective and I was just returning it. The charge for the return postage was over $23. The amount of the purchase price I paid I have rounded to $248. The company refunded me $107 (rounded). Therefore charging me $141 dollars (rounded). They referred me to Amazon to take care of this matter and I am still waiting for a refund to this day, Wednesday, February 08, 2023. Please beware and keep this in mind if you plan on purchasing a product from this company and need to return it within the alloted 90 days!!

1. The obvious, it’s a 1920 x 1080 res.. The screen res just feels too large when performing tasks related to video and music editing. You will feel like you still need more real estate for editing. Consider a higher res monitor that enables you to see more of the timeline.

2. I didn’t know Dell made “economy” level products. In other words, the plastic on this monitor feels cheap and it is. You can easily twist the bezel plastic from the screen - seriously it’s that thin. I didn’t try to do this on purpose, but simply noticed the thin plastic tilting the monitor.

3. This is not a height adjustable monitor. It only offers tilt. With that said, this monitor is too high compared to my other monitors.

Image Quality
Its decent, bright, colorful, and really not that bad. Text looks good too. I didn’t notice any pixilation with various fonts. Albeit, I only had this monitor for a few days before returning. I’ll explain why I returned this monitor next.

Refresh Rate
So this is listed as capable of a 75 Mhz refresh rate. We’ll that didn’t happen. I tried a couple different cables to make sure I didn’t have a bad cable, and no it’s not my graphic card. I have a sweet fully loaded MBP that is more than capable of driving a monitor… M1 Max processor, 32 core GPU, 64 Gig memory, and a 4 TB SSD.

Conclusion
For the price it’s a decent monitor. Just keep in mind the plastic is thin around the bezel, and this is a 1920 x 1080 res monitor and because of this you may feel like you need more real estate when working with video and audio timelines; at this point consider a higher res monitor.

I figured I’d give this 1920 x 1080 res monitor a try knowing it was likely not going to work for me. As a result, I returned it because I was looking for a primary replacement monitor. I ended up purchasing a 3840 x 2160 res monitor that is capable of delivering the technical capability I am used to.",49,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: SE2722HX

I have two concerns - one the power button on the button right is very small - I would hate to break or damage the switch and not being able to power the monitor on.

Second, the monitor is very easy to move vertically. There have been times when I have bumped into the monitor when I've been switching cables between computers and it moves vertically and I have to straighten it back so it'll be horizontal - one word that comes to mind is ""flimsy."" I can imagine me straighten it and it breaks off the stand completely.

Young,4.0,2022-11-28 00:00:00,美國,,"Keep your expectations tempered and realize that this is NOT a gaming monitor, but it's great for most other work. The primary difference between this monitor and a similar, $600 Dell I use at work is that blacks are NOT black here; they're dark gray. I haven't had any issues even with some pretty advanced photo editing, but this is NOT a monitor for graphic professionals. If your work requires perfectly accurate colors for photo or video editing, buy something else (that costs at least twice as much).

But for normal, non-graphic-professional uses -- including photo editing and light gaming -- this is a great buy for the price ($299 is what I paid). Text is extremely clear, videos look great, and I had no issues on set-up; everything was plug-and-play out of the box.

I DO wish it had a real users manual. Instead, the ""manual"" supplied (and linked from the Amazon page) is just a useless ""how to hook it up"" set of images that most vendors would be embarassed to include. I want to expect more from Dell, particularly considering the poorly constructed menus they include on all their monitors, including the expensive ones.

One note: Despite it expressly not being a gaming monitor, it's fine for non-AAA games. If (like me) you just play older games and don't need a ridiculous refresh rate or perfect blacks, it's fine.",22,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: SE3223Q

Right out of the box, the image is washed out. I had low expectations for a $100 monitor but this fell well below my expectations. My normal process when buying any new monitor is to visit color calibration websites and manually adjust the display. The problem is this display when next to a proper display (such as my LG LG 32QN650-B (as Sub $300 1440p display) looks so bad I don't even want to use it. Furthermore, no amount of calibration can correct the image to something of reasonable quality. I'm stunned others rate this display so highly. I didn't even need to compare it to my LG to see how bad the display performed. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. My previous Dell monitor lasted 15 years and costs $1,500 (back when HD displays cost $$$). That was a great display. This one should be pulled from the market.",0,顯示尺寸: 24 Inches樣式: SE2422HX

I spoke with an Amazon Supervisor that acknowledged they received my monitor back yesterday, the 26th of June. My tracking shows they received it last Friday. On “My Orders” page, they still show they haven’t received it.

I know Amazon won’t go out of business if they give me my credit off $351.00, but I would think if they do this too enough people, it will help their bottom line.

I advised the Supervisor that I will not order anything from Amazon until I receive my credit.
I also don’t think they care about that at all. I read an article yesterday stating Amazon is under investigation for deceptive business practices, I think I can add to the list. I hope for their sake my money will be put back on my credit card by Friday, if not I’m closing my account. Again, I’m sure they won’t care at all, but I will keep my dignity intact as I don’t deceive my clients and I don’t allow others to deceive me.

Also:

When you request a return, make sure you check the box to have them put your credit back on the card you purchased the item from, otherwise they put the money in your gift card account.

Update:

Focking Amazon. I returned it, UPS tracking received it and they are stating I will receive my credit when they receive the monitor back.
I will not place an order with Amazon until the credit is on my credit card. Until then, every purchase I make will be on my Walmart account

I sent the monitor back, it is easy to dark, even at the brightest setting. I can’t imagine an application where this would be bright enough to complete a task.

I’m debating sending this back. It’s a massive monitor, which is what I wanted. It’s only 300 nits and I’d say I need at least 400, maybe more.",6,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: SE3223Q

Turns out this unit can't handle more than a 2TB hard drive in each of the 2 slots, which nobody mentioned. On-line documentation is terrible, and tech support, while they pick up quickly, is worse. Just trying to tell which of the USB slots are type 3.2 and which are 2.0 took more than a half hour on each of two phone calls. The agents kept saying ""yes"" to just about anything, but even with the diagram (which I pulled up while talking) the agents were unable to differentiate between ""the sockets next to the ethernet port"" and ""the sockets above the ethernet port"" to tell me which was which. After I got the unit, I decided to increase storage capacity. They said all cables were included. Dell charges twice the price for the same hard drive from Amazon, so I got the drive. And purchased the ""drive caddy"" from Dell. Turns out, the cables were NOT included as Dell tech support said. Anyway, machine is working, after many hours on tech support.

The specs on this newer model tell me all I need to know.

Dell has a habit of putting PSUs in this machine that DO NOT cover the bases of the functionality of the other parts. My PC on purchase had a 500W PSU with one of the newest Ryzen CPUs and a brand new 3060 TI. Both of those have a minimum of 550W with the recommended being higher.

I knew it was insufficient when I bought it, but 3000 series graphics cards had just came out and were going for thousands and the pandemic had just started so computer store’s stocks had been wiped. I had to buy a prebuilt.

For the first year or so, my computer would just shut off about once every week without any explanation and just go into repair mode. I troubleshooted it and found it to be PSU failure and tried to keep looking since then.

On purchase, I thought I could just replace the component eventually for minimal cost when it became a problem. If only I knew how wrong I was. Because of the XPS’s compact design, you have maybe one or two options for replacement- either the same PSU with same or lower wattage, or a different brand that barely scrapes by 550W with its size.

I was also having issues with the CPU and GPU running FAR hotter than safe. (CPU clocked in at 95 Celsius once, NOT OKAY) I took the pc apart to find that Dell HAD NOT applied the correct about of thermal paste and the bottom of my CPU was starting to char after about 6 months of use. They maybe used 1/4 of the appropriate amount. I reapplied and cleaned it out very thoroughly and was still having problems. The problems didn’t get better until I took the side of the PC off and jerryrigged a second fan going out. The airflow in the case is HORRIBLE.

It died after about 2 weeks of shutting off at least once a day. The PSU started making a crunching sound last night and I decided to pull the plug so that I can use the good components in a rebuild.

All this to say- don’t buy this. It isn’t quality. I know it is daunting, but consider building your own PC. There are so many incredible YT guides and you can save money and get exactly what specs you want.",0,processor_description: Core i7-12700memory_size: 32 GB樣式: UHD 顯示卡

I wanted to love this PC so much more than I can say I do.

Obviously with such a hefty price tag you're kind of expecting it to have all the bells and whistles and do everything a normal (cheaper) model would do... Right? Well don't expect that here.

To start - there's no disk drive, not the end of the world as most installation data can be found on the web and you can always get an external CD/disk reader or burner depending on what you want/need.. But ultimately kind of inconvenient especially when my much cheaper model has one.

There's also NO HDMI Ports or connections for monitors, as stated in other reviews, it does show in the manual that there should be 4 HDMI ports. So not sure what happened there.. Instead you are left with one single Display Port connection, I attempted to not only use an adapter to connect a monitor via HDMI cable but I fact connected my dual monitor setup with the help of an HDMI adapter/splitter.. It worked, kinda.

I definitely noticed a lot of lag with the dual setup and I also noticed occasionally getting short black screens only to reset back to whatever the screen was.
This was not particularly helpful ~
if I was playing a game or doing something that requires live viewing.

Unfortunately for me running dual monitors is almost imperative and so without being able to work out these kinks over multiple adapters and attempts to get it to work properly, I also started noticing issues with running a capture card though the device and using OBS, something I double checked on my laptop to make sure it was not my capture card or headset going out for any reason, it worked perfectly on my laptop/OBS but was skipping echoing, and overall sounded awful through OBS on this PC.

Other than my OBS issues, and when not running a multi monitor setup I did notice it has a quick startup time and is fast at installing and downloading. I had no issues running many intensive games on it even though that's not it's first intended use.

I would recommend this more for someone who's intending to use it for office work or maybe even photo or video editing (as long as you are OK with a single monitor setup)",7,processor_description: Core i7-12700memory_size: 32 GB樣式: UHD 顯示卡

Productivity or light gaming are both fine, depending on your exact needs. Though while it has lots of memory and a modern processor, anything extremely graphics intensive will be limited. I think that's pretty straight forward to figure out based on the specs.

The main possible issues with this have nothing to do with its performance specs per se.
- The first major issue is the lack of HDMI port. While display port is a fairly common connector, given the integrated graphics it seems odd to me to skip the more common HDMI port and use display port exclusively. It really should have both kinds of ports.
-The second major issue, which admittedly might not be an issue for many people, is the proprietary internals of the system. Due to the power supply, motherboard, and case used there a lot of upgrade options going forward are locked out. While any most hardware failures will be covered by dell's warranty, it would be nice if there were more standardized internals for DIY fixes and upgrades.

Overall the specs and performance are good and it can easily work out well as a family computer, a home office computer (though kind of high spcces in some ways for those), media creation to a degree, or a light gaming computer. It just might not offer the room for growth that other computer solutions would have. And as someone that likes to tinker, I'm just not a fan of things being locked down by unnecessary proprietary redesigns of common components.

It also has plenty of storage space, so I appreciate the 32 GB of memory, as it has come in handy on more than one occasion.

For the noise, there isn't any except when you first power it on. However, after that, the fan is very silent.

I also really like the Intel UHD Graphics 770. It's been a big upgrade from my old graphics card and has made a big difference in my work. NOTHING hasn't crashed on me.

But, when it came to the setup section and connecting my monitor. This was a problem, and it confused me. There were no pictures, just little symbols. I was like, how was I supposed to know what cord goes where? And the paper/instructions it came with was no help at all. So I had to use Google. So this part took longer than it should have.

The other downside is that it can be a bit pricey, but I think it is definitely worth the investment. Especially if you work from home and you need something with more space.

This product exemplifies the many reasons to consider building your own PC over buying a prebuilt.

Let's talk about the things this prebuilt does right.
* The motherboard has one additional M.2 slot for a PCIE SSD and an additional hard drive bay.
* It also has a 2x16GB dual channel memory configuration instead of using a single 32GB stick. Maybe it's because DDR5 is still too new?

Unfortunately, that's about where the good parts end. Now for the drawbacks.
* This is an expensive prebuilt, yet this comes equipped with a pathetic 450-watt power supply. If you were thinking of adding a high-end GPU to this, you'll be severely disappointed.
* The CPU cooler also appears to be a generic Intel stock cooler, so even if you manage to upgrade the power supply and add in a GPU, you'll probably face thermal CPU bottlenecks due to such a weak cooler if you're playing demanding titles.
* The motherboard also only has 1 DisplayPort as the output.",5,processor_description: Core i7-12700memory_size: 32 GB樣式: UHD 顯示卡

I was hoping to throw a 3060ti or 3070 in it and turn it into a great gaming machine, but when I checked the PSU wattage I realized it's a paltry 460 watts, which is well below the recommended wattage for even a low-end GPU like a 3050. To make matters worse, it appears that the PSU and motherboard are a proprietary combination, so I can't change out the PSU for a more powerful one. So I'm stuck with an oddly powerful machine, that can only run very low-end older GPUs.

I recognize that it was purpose-built to the selected specs, and the weak PSU is weak to save a dollar, but it wouldn't have cost Dell much to include a 650-750w PSU to allow for upgrades and customizability. Very disappointed.

Aside from the PSU issue, it does run fine. Had no problems booting, and it performs as I would expect given the specs.

2nd impression: None of my three monitors plug in anywhere. Found what appeared to be an appropriate one on the Dell website. Asked tech support one simple question: if that Dell monitor would plug in and work with this Dell Computer. 20 minutes of gobbledygook later, he said yes, so I bought it. Went to plug it in, and found his instructions were wrong. Eventually I figured it out for myself. The ""documentation"" that came with the monitor consisted of small pictures with the various ports only identified by a small icon with a foreign-language ID.

Third: It comes with an SSD ""boot"" drive, and a 2 Tb. ""data"" drive. However all programs you install go directly to C:, which is on the BOOT drive. Won't last long, and won't hold much.

Fourth: The CD-ROM is cheap and terrible. It appears to have irreparably damaged all the Macrium boot CDs I tried in it. Fortunately THIS old computer still works well enough that I can burn more.

So, my conclusion: DON'T buy it or anything else DELL!

It has been running smoothly and quietly without any problems. It is affordable product so far. I will update this review if any problems arise in the next months.

The model pictured includes the water-cooled AIO, which is only available for K-type processors. Note that purchasing a non-K processor will land you the small fan that you see pictured in the product page (4th photo at time of this review). If you purchase the K-type through Amazon, you may only get the advanced air cooler without liquid cooling so be wary of this. Liquid cooling runs very quiet.

Also pictured is the NVIDIA GeForce 1650 Super, which I chose because I am not a big computer gamer. Note that the motherboard's default output is only one DisplayPort 1.4. If you wish to have multiple displays, you will have to upgrade to the RTX 3060, which includes 3 x DisplayPort 1.4 and 1 x HDMI 2.1.

I purchased this with a M.2 NVME boot drive and additional 2TB HDD (top right). This is also upgradeable with a second HDD (top left). Note that you will have to purchase additional pieces in order to add an extra HDD. These pieces are very specific, so I've provided links to the specific products available on Amazon.

I have an office in my house that I setup to be equal to what I had at work when I was as an engineer. The only problem is my wife who is also an engineer is working from home and is now the primary user of the home office. This created a huge issue as I need access to the main house computer, need a attend remote grad school, and need an area to do hw. I purchased a Dell Inspiron 3493 core i5 (14 in screen) to be a mobile PC for school and to be used as a secondary main house computer when I don't have access to my primary one. I took over my wife's vanity table and converted it to my new work area. Working on a 14 in screen on the go is good, but working on it for hours is a pain due to lack of screen size. The Dell D3100 was the solution and allowed me to repurpose two old monitors I had lying in the attic. No USB 3.0 docks on the market charge a laptop because they were designed for laptops that do not have USB-C or thunderbolt ports on it (my exact laptop) which actually make them more/true universal compared to USB-C/Thunderbolt docks. Saying that I love this dock as it has allowed me to work/study without strain and my productivity isn't hampered because of lack of screen(s). The dock has also allowed my work area (a small vanity table) to be clutter free which is essential to maximize space. I have dual monitors, logitech C270 cam, wireless keyboard (logitech K360), ethernet, and dual speaker with amp all attached to the dock; plus three free USB 3.0 ports that are easy to access. change a few power settings to prevent the laptop from automatically falling asleep when plugged in and the lid closed. Don't turn the laptop off, just manually put it to sleep when you are done using it, and you can wake it up via the wireless USB keyboard or mouse which makes this very convenient. I did notices that when you use both monitors on the dock, internet speeds are reduced (but honestly it isn't noticeable) probably due to thru put of the USB 3.0 cable and the dock does get warm with use I have noticed.
Because this docking station does not charge, it is 100% universal compared to the ones that do. I noticed that all these brands of docking stations advertise how much charging power they supply ONLY to their brand of laptop but they do not state this at first or second glance. It is very misleading when they are calling it universal. 210 W charging for our brand but 90 W max only to other brands (you have to really dig for this information). You might end up sending almost $400 on a dock that is no better than a $140 dock.
My wife needed a truly universal dock to work on her HP Zbook 15 G5 and to work on a Dell equivalent when her company changes their laptops and is demanding the return of all their docking stations. She currently is using a HP 230 W dock which will only supply 90 W to the Dell equivalent laptop (same is true for a dell 240 W dock on a HP laptop) meaning the laptop will need to be also plugged into its power brick when docked. So I figured why buy a $400 dock that will require her to plug in the laptop's power brick to use it when I can buy this dock (Dell 3100) for $140 and be in the same situation but for much less money. for convenience, but buy a second power brick for $40/50 and it will still be cheaper than a $400 dock that only supplies 90 W to laptops that aren't the same brand as it is. **update: my wife's work laptop has an integrated NVIDA Quadro P2000. My biggest fear was bc of the dock being USB 3.0 vs. the others, the laptop would use the integrated graphics on the CPU only and bypass the integrated NVIDA Quadro P2000 as I have read would happen. GOOD NEWS: the integrated NVIDA Quadro P2000 GPU is being utilized and there was no bottle necking. the setup works perfectly.**
The dell 3100 docking station has been great and is an excellent value that solved all my problems and needs (and my wife's too). for those that have spoken poorly about this docking station simply haven't done research on docking stations period.",39,樣式: USB 3.0

I bought this doc as it was recommended by the Amazon sales algorithm of ""Frequently Bought Together.""

This docking station is in fact compatible with my Dell laptop and does work as designed, but it does not offer the features I thought it did. The two features I thought it had was the ability's to power my laptop and pass data back and forth to my laptop all with one cable. This dock does not do that. The docking station that does this connects to the laptop through a USB-C cable, not a USB-3 cable. Also, the second feature that I thought I was buying was that the docking station is only a 60 Wat AC adapter. I thought that could power my laptop at my desk, and then I would be able to use the AC adapter that came with the laptop as a ""travel adapter."" Unfortunately, this is wrong on two points: First, the dock does not power my laptop directly through the data cable, and Secondly, the laptop I bought requires a 90 Wat AC adapter. This means the AC adapter that came with the dock, only powers the dock, and the AC adapter that powers my laptop must be used at my desk and on the road. Further, this means crawling under my desk to plug and unplug the AC adapter every time I need to take the laptop with me. That is a hassle I would like to have been able to avoid. (Many a time I have left the house only to have found I forgot to bring my AC adapter. It is better to have an extra one that always lives in the laptop bag.) As a final note, I am not returning the dock just yet. Before you can use this dock it requires a driver download before first use. On the download page, it asks what OS you are using? Windows, macOS, Android, Chrome OS, or Ubuntu. As I said earlier, it does function as designed. I likely will be able to use this on a different device. Hope this helps.",8,樣式: USB 3.0

The dock failed to work properly when connected to my system. The source of my problems was originally not clear, although ultimately identified as the dock & Dell tech support. Here's the long version of my problem. I purchased the Dock along with a Dell XPS 15 laptop and Dell U2713HM monitor, all purchased new at the same time. Both the computer ($2000) and the monitor ($500) are made for ultra-high-resolution display (maximum 3200x1800 and 2560x1440 respectively). They do not match resolution, despite the assurances I got on this point from Dell before purchasing the equipment. Prior to purchase I was told by two separate Dell answer-line people that these three products (laptop, monitor, Dock) were designed to work together. It is obvious they were not.

Initially the monitor did not work (black screen) when connected through the dock, or directly to the laptop. Two different Dell tech support technicians spent a cumulative 5 hours (with me a hostage assistant) working remotely on my system, resetting and re-installing every possible driver and setting and cable configuration, plus having me purchase additional cables. Unfathomably, the DVI and VGA cables supplied with the UltraHD monitor do not support its full resolution; you must purchase additional cables for it to reach its full, advertised resolution.

With no help from Dell tech support I accidently discovered that the computer-monitor connection (either with or without dock) will not function if the Screen Resolution setting is ""Duplicate these Displays"". Any other setting works. After solving that ""problem"" my monitor works fine when connected directly to the laptop. Connections through the D3100 Dock work only intermittently. This includes both monitor display and keyboard communications.

After Dell Tech Support recommended purchasing additional cables, which also did not solve the problems, my case was elevated to Dell's ""HD resolution specialist"" who confessed having never worked with a D3100 dock before, so wasn't sure what to expect of it. After having me perform more tests and having me install more drivers, communicating only by email, she eventually concluded that either the dock is faulty or maybe I need to re-install the computer OS. It took 2 weeks' of occasional email to reach this indecisive conclusion.

It has taken one month to get to this point, the source of the problem and its resolution are still not known decisively, and Amazon is out of stock on the D3100 dock until end of February. I asked the Dell Tech Support specialist if they could handle the Dock replacement in order to expedite finding a solution to my problems and she promised to let me know. That was 5 days ago; still no response. If the replacement Dock doesn't work I'm faced with an OS re-install that also may or may not work. This is not Dell's cheapest equipment by a long shot. I expected a lot more of both their equipment and especially of their tech support. It will be a long time before I think of purchasing Dell equipment again. I can only wonder: how would Apple have handled such problems if it was their equipment?

Update 1/18/15: I exchanged my D3100 for the same product two weeks ago and the new dock has worked well during this time. Apparently my problems stemmed from a hardware failure in my original dock. I would give the new D3100 a 5-star rating if not for the fact Dell tech support was both helpless and apathetic about assisting me to diagnose what was the cause of my connectivity problems (I was on my own to figure out if it was caused by my new computer, new monitor, or new dock). I'm raising my rating to a 3-star because the hardware is good if it is functioning, but lack of product tech support and misinformation from Dell denies it a higher ranking.",14,樣式: USB 3.0

And a wireless keyboard and mouse. But there are several things it doesn't do that even my cheaper off-brand dock did:
-the connector from the dock to the laptop is USB-A. Most laptops in 2023 have USB-C (including mine). I had to use an adapter (luckily one came with my Samsung phone). The connector itself is a cable with its own port on the dock, as opposed to one that is permanently connected/part of the dock.
- the dock connects to AC power but it doesn't power the laptop! WHAT? I have to use the adapter that came with the laptop. (Again, luckily, there are two type C ports on that side of the laptop.)
- although the USB port works for my wireless keyboard and mouse, it doesn't work for my headset. I have to plug that directly Into the laptop.
- the power light is way too bright. Had to cover it with a piece electrical tape.

I mentioned a cheaper off-brand dock that this one replaced. The only problem with that was it took several disconnects and reconnects sometimes to get both monitors to work. BUT it supported my wireless keyboard/mouse and my headset at the same time, all without connecting to AC power -- it just used the power from the laptop I guess.

Initially connected with Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 on a Broadwell Dell notebook, and it was terrible- a torturous, tearing fiasco like you can't believe.

Tested briefly with a Win 10 laptop (Ivy Bridge hp ProBook 6470b), and it automagically downloaded everything it needed within a couple minutes, and all was well. I decided to fetch the latest dock driver from Dell's website and push it onto the device while I had the Windows notebook plugged in. No apparent change. Switching back to Gnome afterwards was still unbearable.

So I did apt install xfce4, rebooted into XFCE, and it works really well. Tried again with clean installation of Ubuntu 16.04.1 (""normal"", with Unity), and it worked surprisingly well too. I don't know what the deal was with Gnome being so awful. It's a shame, too, since I really like Gnome, and it's what I always use on my CentOS and Fedora installations.

Dock is currently connecting AmazonBasics A100 USB-powered speakers (consuming a USB 3.0 port and an audio jack), two external 1080p monitors over HDMI, and a USB keyboard and mouse over the two USB 2.0 ports. All is working as expected. I may check back in a few days after I add my third monitor.

This setup appears to have very little discernible CPU penalty.

Cool bit of kit. Kind of dense for its size, and the underside creates enough friction to keep her pretty still on a desk. Well thought out.

02.06.2017 udpate: I had trouble adding a third external display (all three external monitors are matching 1080p ViewSonic). Can't recall error message, but I couldn't populate the display on a third monitor. I just worked around the issue by running HDMI directly from laptop to one of the external monitors, and I let the D3100 feed the other two (one via HDMI, the other uses a Displayport-to-HDMI adapter for the moment). Just note you may have a problem with three displays.

It worked fine for several months, and then one day after not having used it for a week, it stopped working. No amount of playing with it could restore operation. Although it was past the return date, Amazon sent me a new one. 8 months later the second one also quit, and Amazon offered to have them both returned for a full refund. Meanwhile I ordered a Baseus Triple Monitor Docking station. While waiting for the Baseus, I did some research online, and someone suggested unplugging everything from the Dell, and then just plugging in the computer cable, followed by the monitor cables. Lo and behold the Dell started working again. I tried the same procedure with the first unit, and it worked fine as well. What I did find, however, is that with two monitors hooked up to the HDMI outputs, and the third monitor hooked up to the 20 pin DisplayPort output, the frame rate was only about 14-15 fps. If the third monitor is attached directly to the HDMI output on the laptop, the frame rate jumps to 30 fps.

So the takeway is twofold:
1) If the unit stops working, turn everything off, unplug all the cables, then turn on the computer and the docking station, plug the docking station into the computer, and then plug in all the monitors.
2) For gaming, plug the third monitor into the laptop directly, so the docking station acts as a ""dual"" rather than a ""triple."" For regular computer use, plugging all three monitors into the docking station is just fine.

By the way, Amazon said to just keep both working docking stations, and not to bother sending one back. Gotta love their customer service!",39,樣式: USB 3.0

Beane, IV",4.0,2015-09-18 00:00:00,美國,,"Well, I have been using one of these docks for almost a year now, and I have been extremely impressed. The picture quality is great, and the functionality is very reliable. I do, however, have two complaints.

Firstly, the setup is not as simple as it should be. There is firmware available on the Dell website, as well as on the DisplayLink website, but no native software application for managing the displays once installed. You are forced to use the Windows display management software, which is absolutely not user friendly, especially if you are running triple monitors or more. It takes some time to get everything set up and working properly, but once you get it done, you should not have any further issues.

Secondly, this dock has a DisplayPort output. If, however, you own or intend to purchase monitors, like my three Dell U2414H flat panels, with MST (Multi-Stream Transport) capability (aka Daisy Chaining) you will be disappointed to learn that this dock does NOT support MST. Rather than connecting multiple monitors to one display output, you have to run a separate video cable for every single monitor. What's worse, the dock only has one DisplayPort output, the other two outputs are HDMI, so if your monitors came with DisplayPort cables like mine did, you will have to buy additional HDMI cables as well...

None of these issues is a deal breaker, and now that I am set up, I am EXTREMELY happy with the end result, but just a little bit of info I wish I had known prior to making my purchases.",590,樣式: USB 3.0

I regularly need to share keyboards, mice and one or both of the screens between the desktop and laptop.

I have a Dell thunderbolt connection (TB16 docking station). The TB16 only has 1 HDMI and a display port. I bought HDMI switches thinking that I could use a connector to HDMI for the display port. I was wrong.

I then found this thing. It is cheaper, has 2 HDMI ports and is compatible with every computer I use. I've used a Lenovo t480, Asus chromebook and the XPS 13 (9360). Ironically, the XPS is the one that has trouble. The XPS does not pick up the ethernet and the dimensions of the connected monitors look funny. The background image is just larger on the monitors but otherwise works well and there might be a way to fix this but it hasn't bothered me enough to figure it out since my wifi connection is strong enough.

It is otherwise truly and awesome solution and has eliminated several other more complicated solutions to share 2 screens across 2 monitors (each monitor only has 1 HDMI). It even works with my corsair k95 and logitech g502 (which can be fussy with docking stations).

BTW, I only use this for HD not 4K or any higher resolution. Also - I wouldn't recommend going used because the vendors take forever and mine came without the USB type A to type B cord. The HDMI switches that I'm using are the Roofull 5 in 1. I'm also using a USB 3.0 switch (ABLEWE).

I did all the troubleshooting (e.g., updated firmware, deleted selected registry items, used MS software to clean the cache). I even invested in top-of-the-line cables. Nothing worked. I suppose I could have asked for a replacement from Microsoft. But working with the sales folks at Microsoft can sometimes be a challenge. Out of desperation, I purchased the Dell USB 3.0 Ultra HD/4K Triple Display Docking Station (D3100). I left the charging port connection between the laptop and the MS docking station 2 (for charging purposes, printer connection, and external hardware connection). In addition, I plugged the Dell dock into one of my two left USB Type A ports on my Microsoft Surface Book 3 - where I connected two individual HDMI cables to the Dell dock and my two monitors. This gave me three total monitors - one from the laptop and two external monitors.

I've found one's with dual display but those weren't the ones I needed. I however bought one that was connected through USB-Type C and figured I could use a USB-Type C to mini display port adapter to it but was not able to make it work.

So I decided to go all in on this docking station not knowing if it would work or not and I must say I am very happy with my purchase.

I have a Dell laptop for work that clicks into a (Dell PR03X) docking station. I hate the docking station. It's just difficult to get the laptop connected to it and the docking station only allows for 2 extra monitors, not 3. So I had to buy an external USB video card for my 3rd monitor.

I purchased this as a replacement for my PR03X dock and it's an EXCELLENT replacement. For one thing, I can use it with all my laptops, not just my Dell. I have a Lenovo Yoga (my wife's), a Macbook Air (2011 with OS 10.9 - which required the software from http://www.displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.php), and my work Dell laptop. All 3 work great with this little hub. And it is pretty small and lightweight.

Note: I wasn't really sure how this was going to connect to my laptop(s). It turns out it connects via a typical USB (2 or 3) port. My Macbook Air has USB 2, while my Lenovo Yoga has USB 3.0. Both work flawlessly. However, obviously the extra USB ports the device provides won't operate at USB 3 speeds if you're connected to your laptop via a USB 2 port.

Anyway, once you've connected the doc to your laptop (or desktop) via a USB 2 or 3 port, its ready for up to 3 monitors to be connected to it. Two via HDMI and a third via Dell's DisplayPort (which you can get a DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter if needed). So with the laptop screen this gives you a total of up to 4 displays!

The One Con:
It seems like video playback might be a little choppy when watching a 1080p video clip on YouTube while connected to a USB 2 port. I'm not sure if this was the internet or a FPS limitation of the USB video throughput. However, it seems to playback video flawlessly using a USB 3 port.

So if you're considering this for video work or for gaming and you don't have a USB 3 port to plug it onto, you may find it slightly laggy and you may want to do a little more research. But again, I see no lag using USB 3.

But if you want to use typical applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, ect. - or in my case a text editor like Sublime Text, this little dock will work great, even when using the slower USB 2.",82,樣式: USB 3.0

This laptop was recently issued to employees to replace their 'old' Panasonic laptops that had TWO HDMI ports. Frankly, we all still can't figure out why the laptops were changed when they really just just needed bigger hard drives. Everything else was fine.

Anyway, to work effectively, employees all need to use their two personally owned monitors yet there's only the one HDMI port. I'm my spouse's tech support & tried using an HDMI adapter/converter that I ordered here last week, but because those adapters are not plug 'n play as they are all advertised, it wouldn't work on the company issued laptop because software needed to be installed, and employees are not authorized to install anything, not even a printer, or a display adapter/converter.

Having worked for the same company myself, I remembered that this Dell Docking Station has been standard-issue for many years (still is) so I decided to order one to see if it would work (Thank you seller: ZRM Industries!).

I plugged everything in today, fired up the 'ol laptop and everything works! No drivers to install! True Plug 'n Play! ...if there are any drivers, they're likely already installed in the standard 'image' on all company laptops.

It's so nice to plug everything into the dock now, instead of plugging/unplugging everyday into the laptop...all USB devices, headset, Ethernet, HDMI, & DisplayPort

Not reflected in my review rating is that I got this port ""used-very good"" via Amazon seller ZRM Industries (order was fulfilled by Amazon).

I've only given 4 stars because the power cord doesn't seat very firmly in the unit and every time I try to clean up my cable spaghetti it pops loose.",0,樣式: USB 3.0

Finally, a tech from Dell emailed me the solution: my HDMI to DisplayPort adapter was not an active adapter. So for $20 I ordered a new one and it did the trick. There are still issues but the setup is now functional. Biggest issue now is that after waking my computer, I often have to unplug the dock from power and plug it back. Until I do, my external monitors say ""No Signal"". This issue is much more frequent with the 4k monitor. Also, things do lag a bit on the 4k monitor, like mouse movement. Dell was almost of no help at all... the manager I spoke to was very knowledgeable but couldn't figure out the adapter issue... thankfully, he was faithful to email me about it when he figured it out. But this took over a week.

ORIGINAL POST January, 2016: I bought this last week as I have a new Windows 10 laptop and two external displays. One monitor is plugged into D3100 via DVI to HDMI adapter; the 2nd monitor is a Vizio 4k TV. I've plugged it into HDMI on D3100 and also tried it in DisplayPort using HDMI to DP adapter. The 4k TV continually shows ""No Signal"" even though Windows' Display settings recognize that all three monitors are there. No setting I've chosen, however, will fix the issue. Oddly enough, the 4K gets signal if I bypass the D3100 and plug directly into laptop's HDMI port, which means nothing is wrong with the TV or the HDMI cable. Both HDMI ports on the D3100 work when I plug the DVI monitor into them.

In my research on DisplayLink's forum, I found several users reporting the same issue. One user even stated, ""No 4k TV works through the D3100"". Ouch. Pretty damning for a docking station that advertises it is a 4k docking station!

To top it all off, Dell's support has been a train wreck. They keep asking for some serial number that doesn't exist on their docking stations, their tech support automated system doesn't even give docking stations or accessories as an option, and once I got someone, they knew absolutely nothing about docking stations. So finally they passed me on to some sort of manager, who was knowledgeable but not enough to find a solution. He told me he would research it and get back to me by noon on Wednesday... which he never did. Terrible, terrible, terrible.",0,樣式: USB 3.0

This unit uses DisplayLink technology. I have used another DisplayLink adapter I have used with a Lenovo Miix 8 tablet for a few years. So, understanding a little bit about USB technology properly set my expectations for the performance. If you want to play games on your ""Displaylinked"" devices, you will be disappointed. But if you want to connect a bunch of monitors to display photos, or for office computing duties, you should be thrilled.

A few additional observations:

1. This devices works perfectly with USB2, although you should understand the bandwidth limitations and EXPECT some issues with mouse lag, if you share the same port.
2. Ubuntu is NOT plug and play. I worked on this for about 20 minutes, and couldn't get it to work. I will update later
3. You have to download the updated drivers from Dell - NOT DisplayLink.
4. The 3.5MM sound did not work out of the box, but sound through HDMI worked perfectly.
5. When connecting to a TV, the HDMI output seemed to make the overscan/underscan worse. In other words, the edges of my display were not visible. Had to do some tuning in Windows control panel - display.
6. Network performance on USB 2 is really good - much better than wireless. This is a big deal for use with a tablet.

So the only big issues is putting your mouse on this device and sharing the USB bandwidth with video and network loads. IT WON'T WORK WELL. Use a Bluetooth mouse....

Also, I wish the newer drivers from DisplayLink would work. Relying on Dell for drivers worries me...",2,樣式: USB 3.0

I run a triple monitor display with ethernet, a mouse and keyboard, and a 2.1 speaker setup off this display link from my acer aspire e5. It's a decently powerful laptop handles all the tasks I throw at it with ease but once it gets hooked up to my station in my dorm... well let's just say it's unreliable. It's pretty common for the display link to just choose a random port to not work whenever I turn on my laptop in the morning. Almost everyday it seems I have to troubleshoot either a monitor not picking up a signal (while simultaneously saying it is in display settings) or a keyboard just not turning on and even sometimes the ethernet just decides to sh*t itself.
The fixing aspect is sometimes very easy. All I have to do is unplug it and plug it back in... SOMETIMES, while on other occassions no amount of troubleshooting or driver updates will fix the problem. It'll just not work until it does again (sometimes a port doesn't work for a day or two and then just comes back to life.)
But the most annoying feature of this device by far is that for some god forsaken reason it just turns off and on the display of my main monitor (120hz VG248) at random times. The monitor can be under no stress or a lot of stress, it does not matter the screen will just go black and come back again in a second or two. Really irritating if I'm in a game or something which I sometimes am. (This issue did not exist before the display link)
In conclusion, I would not buy this port again but I'm okay owning it because it was really the only option I had given the specific variety of ports I need for my college setup.",0,樣式: USB 3.0

This is basically a USB hub that will allow you to run more screens and connections than the laptop has connections for. I'm using this to support a work-issued Dell Precision 5540.

Pros : it's USB and setup initially was pretty easy. I have two monitors running extended display + the laptop monitor for 3 total monitors and they all work well. The monitor that is true HDMI has had zero issues. The monitor that is running DisplayPort to DVI will go black for about 4 seconds once in a while. My corporate IT helped me to update the drivers for the docking station but this issue did not resolve. My headsets work no problem.

Cons : this USB hub DOES NOT POWER THE LAPTOP. So you need to keep the power adapter issued with the laptop plugged in AND you need to plug the power adapter in for the docking station. For a WFH office, this will not help you reduce your power strip needs. Honestly, you could get the same performance from a much cheaper off-brand device. If this was not paid for by work, I would have returned it.

1 Display Port

It effectively turns my Surface Go into a usable computer for desktop-type work, as long as too much processing power isn't required.

I've tested this using a Youtube video, an actual video and general spreadsheet sort of things and here's my findings. First I'm using a new Surface pro 3 i7 (1.9, turboclock to 3.3 dual core with hyperthreading) 8GB RAM with an HP monitor at 1680x1050 of so you can compare the utilization for other devices. Watching youtube, I average about 7.3% utilization full screen on the one monitor. While watching a video capiable of 1080p using VLC I averaged about 8%. to note, VLC player spiked to 10% during playback so the actual player is still utilizaing more cycles. Lastly what seems to take up the most CPU utilization was moving the mouse around wildly peaking at 30%, sustaining around 26% and droping as low as 6%. As for networking, I pulled a file steady through the ethernet adapter at 20MBps (approx 160mbps). I tested with my hootoo usb dongle as well and got the same results so this is more than likley a limitation on my network (guess what I need to track down and fix). Lastly I tested USB using a Lexar USB 3.0 drive (older) and maintained a consistant 34MBps write (approx 272mbps) and 42.9MBps read (343.2 mbps). I didn't list any CPU utilization for these as they used less than 3% at any given time. Overall I'm very happy with the dock though I've only had it for a short while I think it was well worth the money. Also you might be asking why I picked this dock over the one built for the surface. 2 reasons, first this is capable of up to 3 monitors, the surface dock isn't. ALso I have a giant protecting case on the surface which doesn't fit within the dock and I'm not the type to take it on and off.",15,樣式: USB 3.0

To get everything working I need to boot with the dock connected, then disconnect and reconnect to get both the audio and displays going. Once the initial faffing about is done though it's great. All the ports work, and although the on-board audio jacks have been giving me problems lately; it's not a major problem for me since there is a headphones jack on my laptop.

It works great with two 1080p screens and I have tried it with three. It was usable but slightly laggy with composing window managers. The linux drivers are still in their early stages and have some ways to go. The main complaint is that each screen effectively uses a CPU core to transfer the frames from the GPU buffer to the device. For me this means I get ~6 of my 8 available processing cores most of the time. For me this isn't an issue since I don't use most of them anyway but if you don't have hyper-threading or a quad core CPU, then you might be in trouble.

There is a noticeable lag between the laptop's internal display and the USB powered displays but unless you were playing games with it I doubt you'll care too much.

All in all I think this is a great product and I would recommend it for someone who uses a laptop but often sits a a desk.

This is a great dock (had it ~1 week). Plenty of ports, including 2 USB 3.0 charging ports. Pretty small, fits great on my small-ish desk, etc. If you have multiple computers (work and a personal, like me), and you have a home desk setup that you're trying to streamline, this is a great choice.

The nonsense: the Dell product page (and the Amazon one) claims this will run a single 4K monitor and 2 full HD monitors. That tells me that I can easily use a 2K and a 1080p together. What it does NOT say, is that if you plug both monitors in using HDMI, it will scale them down to 2048 x 1152. You HAVE to use the DisplayPort in order to get anything above ""Full HD"", as Dell calls it. You can find the truth on the ""Supported Resolutions on the Dell D3100 USB 3.0 Docking Station"" page on the Dell Support site.

Otherwise, it's a great dock so far.",1,樣式: USB 3.0

Reed,3.0,2016-05-04 00:00:00,美國,,"/// July 2016 Update ///

So, I tried editing some photos in Adobe Lightroom only to discover that images were not rendering in the Develop mode. When I plug the notebook directly into the monitor, I get no issues. Clearly the driver issues haven't been worked out yet for MacOS.

I deducted 1 star for the issue and hope that it gets resolved ASAP.

/// June 2016 Update ///

The audio issue was fixed. I needed to change the audio from computer to USB Audio in settings. Now the sound plays through the speakers.

//// Original Review ///

Please make sure you have the latest DisplayLink drivers for MacOS.

I use this dock with a 2014 MacBook Pro 15-inch (running OS X El Capitan) and 2 - Dell U2515H monitors. The monitors have a native resolution of 2560x1440 and the only way to make that work with this dock is using the DisplayPort along with one of the HDMI ports. It will not support that resolution with both HDMI outs plugged in.

I've only had the dock a week, but have noticed some scaling issues when activating Mission Control. The top menu (that displays the desktops) is slight clipped. Not a deal breaker, but i hope this gets resolved with a future software update.

There is also a noticeable flickering that happens with certain video/animation playback. Before I upgraded the drivers, YouTube was almost unwatchable, especially at full screen. That's fixed (installed driver ver 2.5.1), however when I run the iOS simulator (building iOS apps), the simulator screen with flicker when I'm switching views on an app. I may try to re-install the drivers to see if that resolved the issues I mentioned above.

Performance issues aside, the dock works for my needs. I could go back to just plugging the notebook up directly to the monitors w/ the Thunderbolt 2 ports, but this dock will be used w/ a PC laptop so it will do double duty.

I will provide updates if more problems arise or the issues I have get resolved.",2,樣式: USB 3.0

I was worried that there will be some gotchas but there are none from what I see. I'm happy to say that it works well. My ultrabook isn't very powerful and it sometimes has a hard time displaying certain things over the 2560x1440 monitor, but I'm sure if your laptop is powerful enough it'll work fine.

My setup:
- Sony Vaio Pro 11"" laptop
- Asus ROG Swift 2560x1440 monitor
- An old Philips CRT monitor
- Keyboard and mouse
- Ethernet network
- External hard drives

All of the above is working, except for the CRT (but that's because my HDMI-VGA cable is broken, so it's not the dock's fault)

I highly recommend this! So much better using a dock + a portable laptop over having a big heavy desktop computer.

EDIT: One drawback: plugging in a high resolution monitor can use up a good amount of CPU. When I play a youtube video on my 2560x1440 monitor for example, I see a process called ""DisplayLinkManager"" taking up 20-30% of my CPU usage. Not surprising, it's probably compressing all that data to fit through the USB3.0 port. I guess that's the caveat I was worried about. But it really doesn't bother me. But good to know. I'm sure this CPU usage will be higher the more monitors you plug in though!

EDIT2: I plugged in my CRT. Still works awesome :D CPU usage didn't noticeably increase either.",0,樣式: USB 3.0

First and foremost, Dell's provided drivers aren't up to date. Fortunately the thing uses ""Display Link"" so you can DOWNLOAD THE LATEST DRIVERS HERE: [...]
Pros:
- Small form factor, dosn't take up a ton of space on your desktop.
- Uses your device's native video card for processing so if you have a high end GPU you can play games and perform other video intensive tasks
- Supports 3 monitors (2 HDMI and 1 Displayport which you can attach to virtually any monitors even if you have to use adapters). Extra USBs Ethernet, headphones, yay.
- Universal, works on any device running a supported OS and has a USB 3 port.

Cons:
- Not cheap, but you can't seriously expect it to be for this type of device
- Dell's provided drivers don't work on modern OSs, you'll have to seek out and install the latest DisplayLink Drivers to make it work.
- Because it's a universal dock, you'll still need a normal power plug on your device to power and charge it.

So you DO NOT get the cable you need to run 4k out the box. I'm about to pull the trigger for a 4k monitor since I set this up this weekend. Boom. No cable so you need to buy one. In these days I would expect Dell, a company I hold in high regard, to get the product description clear.
Other than that, I hook up the box to my inspiron 15 7559 4k laptop and then download the DisplayLink software. Adjust where the monitors go (in the win 10 settings). It auto-grabs the audio and pipes it to any hdmi device on it with speakers. I put it back to the laptop speakers to get computer control over sound.
However, it just works fine. I have a standard HD 32"", 28"" and my laptop screens all going at the same time. I'm going to order a 4k display and will need to order a cable for it. No big deal, but something to order when you order this box. You pay extra to route the 4k which is specifically the reason to buy the box.",2,樣式: USB 3.0

However, with the latest Windows 10 anniversary update, quality has gone down. My screen now fails to redraw changed areas, and I think it's this device failing to detect the change and update my screen. I'll be editing code and switch to another file, and nothing updates. If I scroll up or down, suddenly I can see the new file, but the screen never drew the content when I flipped tabs. This happens a dozen times an hour, sometimes more, in all my applications. It's hard to describe without seeing it, but imagine you opened a web page and the top 1/3 of the page drew as if it rendered fine, but the bottom 2/3s were still white as if the page hadn't loaded at all. Then you scroll the page and instantly the entire page appears just as it should. Now imagine that behavior in every application you use, a dozen times an hour, and never know if it's a redraw issue, lag, or what, but then you realize it's a redraw issue.

If they got that problem fixed, I'd bump right back to 5 stars. It's an amazing device, frankly. For me, it's driving two 1920x1200 displays PLUS one 2560x1440. And it did a _great_ job up until the anniversary update.

As it stands, I can still work ok, but am getting annoyed. I'm seriously contemplating a new computing solution to eliminate this device, because I can't be working with that sort of irritation for potentially many more months. I work from home full-time on this machine.

I believe this redraw issue is related to just the device for 2 reasons. One, if I'm using my laptop as just a laptop with the built-in screen, I notice no issues. And two, if it were a widespread Windows problem, the internet would be in an uproar and it would have been fixed already.",2,樣式: USB 3.0

I'm only running at 1080 right now, but will eventually look to run a few 2k monitors through it. Seems like this should be able to handle that quite well.

Size is also a big positive. This thing is about the size of my hand (from the base of my palm to the end of my fingers). Given my setup, I could use a bit longer USB cord that goes from this docking station to my laptop, but that's not a fault of the device, itself, and is easily remedied. I don't mind that it doesn't have power to supply to my laptop, but to some people that might be a nice-to-have. I do also like having the 3 USB ports (including one fit for charging devices) and headphone jack on the front.

As this is one of the docking stations i've came across that can connect a MacBook Pro w/ M1 chip to more than 1 monitor. Since the only 2 ports embedded in the laptop other than a headphone jack is USB-C connection, you have to purchase a USB-C to USB-A dongle to connect the Dell docking station to the MacBook.

A previous reviewer stated that you should run the software setup disc on your computer before you hooking up the monitors to avoid troublesome setup issues. I did this and the installation was flawless.

The only issue, and the reason I dropped 1 star off, is that one of my 3 monitors sporadically cuts off and on at times. At first I thought it was the monitor. However, while switching cables around a few times, I realized that whatever monitor was connected to the DisplayPort via an adaptor to HDMI was the one that would do it. So, I'm attributing this to the dock. This issue was noted in a review for the Dell Monitors I bought, but I realized that it wasn't the monitors at all. I will try to troubleshoot this issue if it continues.

Overall, I LOVE this dock. It opened up my whole desktop world. Even the 3 front USB ports are a dream for connecting phones, iPods, USB sticks, or other peripherals.

Both are functional, but the two computers appear to have been refurbished by different companies, have differing hardware, and different issues. The included keyboards and mice were also of differing brands, though these peripherals were brand new on both computers.

7050 #1
-------------
The good: Arrived well packaged in professionally produced protective padding, with labeling indicating that it was refurbished by ""CNB Computers"". Computer itself was absolutely pristine and looked brand new. This unit was assembled in Mexico. Opening the top confirmed that it had a new 256Gb SSD as advertised and the correct RAM. Again, the interior was immaculate and didn't have even the slightest sign of dust or wear. The unit did include an empty M.2 slot, had an internal M.2 wireless adapter, and included the wifi antenna.

The bad: The included power supply was not powerful enough to boot the computer fully, forcing the computer to run in ""low battery mode"" at less than 1Ghz. It was EXTREMELY slow. Connecting it to an appropriate power supply fixed this problem. The included power supply was not usable. Additionally, for some reason, the Windows installation keeps installing Spanish language components. An OS reset did not fix this problem, and a clean OS installation will be my next move. I'll update the review if this resolves the problem.

7050 #2
-----------
The good: Arrived quickly with documentation indicating that it was refurbished by ""SJ Computers"". Included the proper Dell power supply and booted immediately without any problems. This unit was assembled in China. Opening the top revealed that it contained a 256Gb M.2 drive, and not the slower SSD that was advertised (that's a bonus!) USB wifi dongle was attached to exterior of the case. The licensed Windows installation ran without issues or errors.

The bad: The unit was poorly packaged using cardboard and shrink wrap with very little to protect it. The case itself was FILTHY, with dust and sharpie marks on the case immediately noticeable. Someone had tried to scribble out some of the printing on the exterior. The rear of the case showed some bending, suggesting that the unit was dropped or crushed at some point. The filler for the serial port was missing, opening a hole in the back of the case. These issues were purely cosmetic. Internally, I found even more dust in the fan and air vents. It was obvious that it had been cleaned, but not nearly as thoroughly as the first unit. This unit also did not include the internal wifi adapter or antenna, swapping them out for the USB dongle instead.

Overall, I'm fairly happy with both units for the price. While both computers had minor issues and required some work before putting them to use, these are a steal for the price. Spending an additional fifteen dollars on a new power supply, or a half-hour removing some dust and cleaning up a marked case, is a small price to pay for the price/performance ratio of these computers. I wouldn't use them as my main computer, but they're a good option if you're looking for a cheap workstation or a media PC.

Update: Clean OS installation did fix 7050 #1. That computer is now working without any problems. HOWEVER. I utterly failed to notice that the case for 7050 #2 was completely wrong! Those sharpie marks I mentioned? Yeah, they were covering the fact that it's an Optiplex 5050 case. It contains a 7050 motherboard and works fine, but the USB C port doesn't fit correctly. My guess is that the PC was crushed at some point (the bent rear I mentioned) and they just replaced the case top with whatever they had lying around. It sort of works, but it's very unprofessional. Between the dust and the damage, I no longer believe that any real effort was put into refurbishing 7050 #2. If this were being installed anywhere other than an auto shop, I'd be sending it back for an exchange.

Update 2: Reached out to SJ Computers about the top not fitting and some of the physical damage. The company immediately shipped me a new system to replace the #2 unit. The replacement looks brand new. No damage, no problems. Opened the top and it's as clean as the day it was built. Absolutely no problems with it whatsoever, and the vendor was great to work with.

Cost me about $150 for above microcomputer by itself in Dec. 2022. This system looked new, worked flawlessly, and after a very brief setup ran smoothly. Setup consisted of plugging everything in and letting windows update. No codes or anything needed. I also bought a HDMI to HDMI connector (amazon basics) for around $10 and wireless keyboard with touch-pad (Logitech k400+) for ~$30 to use the whole system with my 4k tv so I can stream more easily, and use YouTube on with Firefox with ""ublock origin"" to effectively block all adds so my kid can watch KLT on YouTube without being bombarded with advertisements.

I looked for the ""90 day support"" provider and found it was ""203 Trading LLC."". I stated the issue and asked if I could buy a replacement motherboard (no cpu) because it was already outside of 90 days. They were nice and and sent new power brick out of warranty, but I was pretty clear with them that I was confident it was a dead motherboard. New power brick didn't end up fixing the issue, and then they ghosted me after I told them the motherboard is still dead.

Old PCs should keep running. This is just an example of planned obsolescence by Dell. I'm sure it's as little as poor solder cracking due to it's age, and could have been prevented by 0.002 cents of slightly higher quality component on that failure point.

The computer literally looks brand new. The device will never work with Windows 11, but that is Microsoft's flaw. (The processor does not meet the minimal standards.) The date code on the device puts it age at about three years plus a few months.

The computer came with the wrong front cover installed. This model has one USB-A & one USB-C port on the front panel. The included cover has openings for two USB-A ports which leaves an unsightly gap around the USB-C socket.

The vendor removed a sticker from the front panel and left a substantial gouge in the plastic. They did not remove the adhesive residue which required a few minutes work with alcohol to eliminate.

I removed the cover to inspect the internals and found a large wad of lint in the fan housing. A few toots of canned air removed it.

I fired the unit up and ran updates. Functionally everything seems fine.

I finally realized even the native iMac display was set at 1440p vertical resolution (though it has about the double the pixel density of the Dell, which makes for a very sharp image). So I became less hesitant about trying a 34"" ultra wide of which there are a few to choose from.

The Dell Ultrasharp throws a very nice image and while it can't match the 5K Retina display's pixel count, it still does not disappoint. Small text is ever-so-slightly less sharp and this is most noticeable with bold type. After using it for about an hour, I'm over the 5K obsession.

The wide, curved screen is excellent for business use (like editing text docs side-by-side) and the 60Hz refresh rate is more than adequate here. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on that aspect of monitor specs. Not a photo/video editor either, so no opinion on things like color matching.

The primary USB-C upstream port provides 90w of power and the MacBook immediately recognized the monitor and set the proper resolution. Scaling is flawless. The assortment of built-in ports can also eliminate the need for a separate docking station or hub, depending on your exact needs.

Finally, the one shortcoming: sound. Speakers are adequate for business use and casual music playing, but are not going to impress any audiophiles. Plan on upgrading to standalone speakers if your needs are beyond the basic.

The stand is quite sturdy and heavy, with height and tilt adjustments. Really happy with the choice so far, and the spacious screen plus Mac's virtual desktop functionality opened up a whole new world of usefulness for me.",8,

This monitor has a much higher PPI than a standard 1080p computer screen, the text is much sharper and the images are crisp. I was looking for a comparable screen to the Apple Studio Display and this is probably the closest you will get for the price! I can buy almost 3 of these before getting 1 Studio Display, and honestly the Studio Display is VERY pretty and has 5K resolution instead of 4K but I don't think most people's eyes will notice a difference.

I am using this with a MacBook Air M1 with 16GB RAM and it works perfectly, I've never had any issues with the screen. The trick is to set it to 1920x1080 (Default) instead of 1920x1080 low resolution. With the ""Default"" setting you will get the higher PPI but the monitor will SCALE up so your text size does not shrink. If you set this to 3840x2160 which is the native 4K resolution, your text will be very tiny and hard to read. With the 1920x1080 (Default) setting I get the best of both worlds so I'm very happy.

I have not tried to use the hub on this, but this has a ton of ports. I already have a DisplayLink dual monitor dock (which this works perfectly with), so I did not need to plug all my USB and other cables into the back of the monitor.

This display looks very attractive, the bezels are thin and disappear into the display. I heard the speakers suck, but I don't need it for that so I've not tried it. I removed the built in stand and mounted this to my VESA arm mount and it fits perfectly.

I was mostly right.

The monitor has a great picture, calibrated color, and a really nice design. I cannot fault the monitor performance in any significant way.

The KVM situation is better than almost any solution I have seen, but it has a way to go.

First, one thing that may not be obvious in the various descriptions and reviews is that this monitor does not accommodate two USB-C power/data/monitor connections or even two connections with video/peripherals via single USB-C connections.

You get one USB-C power/video/peripherals connection plus a second connection that is your choice of HDMI or Displayport plus a separate USB-C connection for peripherals. I think this should have been done differently, namely by allowing a second USB-C video/peripheral connection. If you're buying a $600 calibrated 4k screen, you're probably connecting to a USB-C laptop and a desktop that does it too (in my case, a Thinkpad and a Mac Studio).

Second, the huge Achille's heel in the KVM setup is that to send a hotkey signal to switch sources, the computer involved has to be logged in. This makes zero sense. Your keyboard is connected through the monitor, and the monitor should be capable of recognizing ALT+P (or Control-P on a Mac) and switching without relying on the Dell Peripheral Manager software (just like a hardware-only KVM would). When you are trying to switch from a host machine on its lock screen, you have to reach behind the monitor and operate the little joystick to switch sources. This is bad software design compounded by industrial design that is hostile to users. If you can't make the monitor catch the hotkey ""switch"" signal, at least put the source switch on the front and make it one-touch. Note to Dell: Samsung isn't good enough to copy. Look at how NEC handled it with some of their Multisync monitors.

The overall design could be improved slightly as well, hence four stars.

What is up with the port placement? Don't get me wrong - I love having a million ports on a monitor (and this is one of the great things about Dell workstation monitors), but could they be easier to access and have cord exits that are a little more logical? I get the USB-C and USB-B ports on the bottom front edge, but unless you are good with a hand mirror and have perfect coordination, you basically have to wire this monitor resting on the screen, before you put it on the desk. Otherwise, you can't rotate the screen enough to add more cables (USB-C cables and HDMI cables are very stiff, and if you have a lot of them, it can be surprisingly tough to maneuver in new ones).

Having all of the ports face-down presents another novel problem - which is that it's tough to route cables for invisibility to the user. Dell might reconsider and make all ports face straight out from the back - the idea that anyone is ever really looking at the back of a monitor is a fiction reinforced by hair salons, art galleries, and the iMacs on which their employees pretend to work but are really using to cruise the internet all day. The U2723QE is a very serious, functional monitor that is being bought by professionals, and it's more important that the various ports be visible and useful than getting too much into playing petit-Apple. A velcro-equipped wire loom (fabric tube) would work fine.",80,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: U2723QE

I opted for a dual-display setup with a monitor more geared towards gaming and this Dell monitor for everything else. To these ends it has been exceptional - 4K estate with pleasant and accurate colors, adequate brightness (unless you really need HDR tonality) for daytime use and night use, and a good looking frame.

When I'm using it for video and document editing I am very pleased with it - except at night when even a fairly low lamp some twenty feet behind me casts a noticeable haze on the screen. For the most part I got over it, though my old ASUS is pitch black and matte and the difference is silly. Along with this there is a slight bleed of inconsistent light from the edges when I view the screen entirely black, but it's not noticeable during general work. For video editing generally it's more than adequate and probably about as good as the many options I had spent weeks looking at, but unlike some, text and general use looks fantastic, which I really appreciate with the amount of text I am looking at. As a side quirk, the quick menu joystick is uninspiring, offering easy presets between color spaces, but if I want to change brightness (such as from day to night time), it is cumbersome.

This is not a gaming monitor, I will note, though I do not hold that too much against it because it is not the monitor I use for that. I was hopeful I could play RTS or city-management type games, that aren't dependent on fast play-style, in 4K to at least see them gorgeously, but as soon as there is any movement, the ghosting is apparent and cumbersome and ruins the benefit of the resolution. I tried a few FPS games on it, and I will say I would not bother trying them further - though perhaps I am just used to faster refreshing screens now and that has limited a regular 60 hz appeal.

But again, this is not a gaming monitor. For office use (despite the reflections) and video or visual editing (as long as you don't depend on HDR, which few monitors in this class will accurately represent), it's hard to go wrong with this monitor, and it has managed those capacities much to my delight and productive ease. Despite the many other options I chose this over, I have no regrets and comfortably use it daily.",25,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: U2723QE

I'm using it mainly for online piano lessons, replacing a 20 year old Dell Ultrasharp that kept disconnecting from the Macbook, probably because I had to use HDMI through an adapter to the Macbook. It was very annoying. I have to use an external monitor with the Macbook as the screen is just too small, (keep that in mind if you're shopping for a Macbook.)

I tried to monitor on both my PC and Macbook Air, and although smaller than the Alienware monitor on my PC, the 4K looked really good on 4K-youtube videos. You should keep in mind though that 4K requires a higher speed plus if you have a data limit, you might just go over it if you watch 4K everyday all day. If you buy a 4K TV to use all day long you'll probably need to upgrade your monthly ISP plan.

On a side note, I have a Kawai MP11SE digital piano and am leaning piano through Playground Sessions. Everything connected automatically without having to search through the Kawai manual to find the right settings, (unlike my Roland piano which required a lot of Googling.) The monitor's line out jack connects to the Kawai's line-in jacks, controlled by a slider to match the piano's volume.

I really wanted a 27"" monitor for work flow and productivity purposes but the 24"" LG won, and here's why.

I couldn't believe I gave up the 27"" however, screen quality and MacBook integration along with Thunderbolt 3 played the biggest role in my decision. The Dell didn't look great side by side, although equipped with 1.07 Billion colors, 4K 3840x2160 screen resolution, along with so many connection ports (another reason I bought the Dell) I couldn't sleep at night. If the Dell was capable of 500cd/m of brightness, Mac integration and Thunderbolt, hands down I would have kept it.

So just to recap: if you are connecting your computer to this monitor by way of HDMI cable or Display Port cable, you will ALSO need to run a usb-c cable from your computer to the monitor in order to get sound. Another related point of frustration is trying to use the KVM to attach two computers to this monitor. In order to use the KVM, you have to prove to the monitor that each computer has an HDMI or Display Port cable attached AND that each has an upstream usb-c attached at the same time... not sure how you do that since there is only one upstream port on the monitor.

The biggest difference between this monitor and my Apple monitor is ease of use. I hooked up the Apple monitor and it worked. I had to figure out how to hook this one up.

I do like the Dell stand to VESA mount system. It is easy to remove the stand, or not put it on in the first place, and attach the VESA plate to the back of the monitor. Unfortunately Dell put in too short screws that cannot be used with the VESA plate. I have a VESA mounting kit with lots of various size screws and was able to cobble something together.

Pros:
UV Filteration Protection
Deeper black color space.
USB-C Alt Display Mode+ USB Hub built in, 1 x DP, 1 x HDMI

Cons:
* White color space is way off if side-by-side (I have 2 monitors at vacation home, hardly powered regardless its purchased months apart)
* USB-C port I can not seem to get beyond 4k@30Hz on both Dell Precision and Gigabyte Aero Thunderbolt Docking station ports with out some sort of adapter, recent discovery.
* I work hard also like to have enjoy my break time through out the day, switching to my gaming laptop input on this particular monitor is that more annoying, including DellDisplay Manager app which does not support newer AltDisplay mode to HDMI/DP through docking stations through .

Summary:
I am a Thunderbolt dedicated user, using factory short cable long cable, 70$ expensive active thunderbolt cable, different TB-Docking stations, I've done it all.

* My Dell Precision 5540 - mentioned in spec it has limited support to 4K @ 30Hz (if direct Thunderbolt connection is made as AltMode display). But depending on my Docking Station + HDMI adapter connected hardware it does allow 4K @ 60Hz (such as using Docktek HDMI 8K adapter)
* My Gigabyte Aero 15 gaming laptop (windows 11) - it should support 4K@60Hz with no issue with no specific docking required or adapter via Type-C connection

What I think this monitor truly annoying part is switching between inputs through out the day, if you are frequent input switcher between work & play be aware, you might end up needing a dedicated external HDMI switch box, that adds up even more $.",1,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: U2723QE

It's an Rtings pick with solid picture quality. Hardware feels solid too. The OSD is very sane and rotates 90 degrees (love that). I love how many ports are on this thing -- the sheer number of USB ports makes this thing a real dock.

I bought this as dock-monitor hybrid -- now that USB-C is picking up steam, I wanted a second monitor that I could keep plugged into my PC and peripherals that I can switch over to my work MacBook with a single cable. This is very close to solving that problem, but falls frustratingly short. After connecting it to my PC via Displayport, I switched it over to my MacBook with a USB-C 3.1 / 3.2 gen 1 / 10Gbps cable. Hooray -- it didn't light itself on fire. But this is where the problems start.

First off, the experience was crazy laggy compared to the USB-C experience on my Acer Predator X34 GS. I think that, with peripherals taking up some of the USB-C bandwidth, 4K@60hz is just too much. But even for a 30hz monitor, it feels more sluggish than it should for some reason. Making things worse, I couldn't find an easy way of reducing the monitor's resolution to mitigate this, so at work I'm stuck with a sluggish monitor. Hilariously, despite my peripherals being connected to this Dell monitor, everything felt smooth on the X34 -- maybe this is entirely on video stream compression lag.

Then, I decided to take a break and unplugged my MacBook. Now, the monitor doesn't recognize my PC over DisplayPort *at all* (still haven't fixed this), which is pretty funny since the X34 GS I'm typing this on now handled the switchover perfectly. And to make matters worse, my wireless Logitech mouse doesn't work until I physically yank and re-plug-in its dongle.

1.) IPS Black is noticeably darker to the point where it was almost jarring when I first switched from my previous regular IPS monitor. It won't ever be a match for an OLED, or even a VA, but it offers a noticeable improvement.
2.) The KVM switching is so intuitive and painless that I don't think I can live without it now. Seriously, simply having all my connected USB devices automatically switch to whichever computer is currently controlling the monitor is a killer feature!
3.) Being able to hook up my laptop with a single cable for power, USB Hub, and display is also a killer feature that I can no longer live without.
4.) Excellent color calibration out of the box with an sRGB mode to make it even simpler.

BAD:
1.) The stand is kinda wobbly on my standing desk, so I had to replace it with a VESA mount that was a lot more sturdy.
2.) IPS Black is still IPS with all the good and bad that that entails.

The overall flexibility in usage options, the jog dial for manual adjustments and the DELL software for PC management, the ease of applying updates, HDR10 w/preset options, DCI-P3 v2, USB-C daisy chaining, a built-in KVM, PBP and Pip, the list of features is almost too long to cover.

The monitor comes with a three year warranty, but when I contacted Dell to register the monitor I was told that I had to fill out a warranty and ownership transfer request and that it could take up to ten business days to process. Today, on the tenth day, I contacted Dell and was told that the request was denied because I needed to provide the order number that governed Dell's shipment of the monitor to the IT Parts Store. I telephone the IT Parts Store and they told me to submit the issue to them via Amazon. I just did that and am awaiting their response.

The monitor is no good to me without the warranty.

Dell's process for warranty and ownership transfer is far less than transparent. And, in my case, if you didn't buy the product directly from them you are treated like a second class customer.

I am not sure the dollars saved on the purchase price is worth the aggravation of my current situation.

UPDATE NOVEMBER 23, 2022

On Monday November 21, 2022 after 15 emails and three phone calls starting on October 26 I finally received notice from Dell that my requested transfer of ownership and warranty from the seller (IT Parts Store) was approved. Luckily during one of my phone calls, I happened upon a Dell employee who stepped up and facilitated the transfer. There were also multiple emails and calls with the IT Parts Store. They also offered to assist and requested to Dell that the transfer take place.

Having official ownership and warranty brings closure to this ordeal, but does not change my assessment that for me the dollars saved were not worth the time and effort that I spent to secure something that should have transferred automatically.

It usually doesn’t detect my dell laptop or Nintendo switch when I replug them.

I have tried all types of cables: hdmi, usb-c, dispaly port but nothing different. Tried to update the firmware from Dell support but nothing changed.

The design is bad. Ports are hidden and hard for users to plug the cables in. I have to slide the motor to the highest position, sit down look up to be able to see the ports. The hdmi and display ports are even harder to use because they’re hidden behind the stand.

The monitors met my expectations in build quality (nothing special - plastic; but, no bad seams). Light bleed on the 32 is about what I expected, light bleed on the 27 was a little worse.

I do not use the USB hub. But, I had three inputs connected on the U2723QE: Mac Studio (USB C), my work Dell laptop (DisplayPort), and an HDMI switch with Apple TV and TiVo Mini.

If using this monitor with one input, it's fine. The problems arise when you want to switch inputs often and quickly. it's unreliable and too slow: 10+ seconds to switch - IF it recognizes the hotkey command.

Ah, yes, the hotkey commands -- the Dell Display Manager software would frequently crash or ignore the keypress altogether. And, if you switch inputs to take a quick look at something and switch back in less than 30 seconds, often it wouldn't switch.

When my Mac was configured to mirror the same picture across all monitors, the U2723QE was not able to be controlled AT ALL. I had to switch to expanded desktop mode, switch the input, then change back to mirrored mode on my Mac desktop.

And while there is a joystick/button, it's on the back and out of reach in my setup. And, can take 2-3 pushes/clicks to navigate to the appropriate input (and this is after configuring the menu ""shortcut). And, 10+ long seconds to switch the display.

I wanted to use this as a 3rd display and occasional TV. To use as a TV, you'll need external speakers or a soundbar. I did purchase the Dell SB521A soundbar; but, it sounded horrible and had NO way to control the volume, either manually or via a remote (no volume control on the soundbar). Granted using the U2723QE as a TV is not its intended use, but I had hoped I could make it work.

So, I returned the U2723QE to Dell and am looking for an alternative. The Benq PD2705U looks like it may meet my needs with the variety of inputs and built-in speakers with volume control; as well as front buttons which (I hope) will support fast input switching.

The Dell U2723QE is a decent option if looking for a primary monitor and you don't switch inputs often (and are patient). As mentioned, I had previously purchased the U3223QE to use as my main display and it's fine (I don't switch inputs often with it). But, adding a second and switching back and forth between mirrored & expanded desktops, and switching inputs often, the multiple Dell monitor solution doesn't work for me.",1,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: U2723QE

This monitor is an incredible value, it went on sale for two fifty, at that price I couldn't pass it up. It does not cause me any eye strain, the picture is very sharp and clear, 27"" 4k is a huge upgrade form a 1080p display. The colors are rich and vibrant, and the blacks / contrast ratio is very good. I used the rtings icc calibration profile they have for this monitor and it improved the accuracy very noticeably, color accuracy is spot on now. For most users, it will be a great choice, if you are a gamer wanting high refresh rate, or you want a monitor that is meant for HDR content, you might want to look at a bit higher end. For me, I use it with my main PC and mostly for browsing and media consumption, reading & working. I spend many long hours daily staring at a monitor, so it's important that it has no PWM backlighting / is flicker free. This monitor does not cause me any eyestrain. It's been great for casual gaming, movies, editing, etc.. can't beat it for the price imo! It might not be the latest and greatest, but I think this is the best value 4k monitor available atm.

Perkins,4.0,2023-09-06 00:00:00,美國,,"i had bought this for my son's birthday. here are my comments:
- the screen is an LCD. i know that i wasn't going to get a big fancy OLED this size for under a thousand dollars, but i feel like the manufacurer had deliberately avoided mentioning the screen type. however, the color quality and visual quality are much better than my previous setup (a 41 inch 30hz LCD samsung smart TV).
-the volume is probably the best thing about this: loud sounds are hushed down and background sounds are very easy to hear, ideal for horror or stealth games. i actually have the volume at 1% because xbox doesn't seem to have a native volume control, so i'm sure the speakers could be deafening if you wanted.
-the curved screen makes it easier to sit closer to the screen without hurting your eyes, and while the colors don't go very dark, lighter off-whites are very easy to spot. i can't wait to use this for digital drawing.
assembly also just involved clicking together a two-piece stand and inserting cables. the monitor even moves a bit to make cable insertion easier.
but my favorite thing is that this product is ""dumb"", it doesn't have any eavesdropping virtual assistants, unneeded internet connectivity, or ads. i bet that it was only $360 because dell marketed this as a ""monitor"" rather than a ""home entertainment platform"", however it still has the quality graphics one would expect from a modern appliance.

i am a bit mad at amazon for not putting the product into an anonymous brown box before leaving it on my doorstep at 3:30 PM, but i can't blame the seller or manufacturer for that.",3,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

It's also the first curved monitor and I have no issues with this particular feature, and kind of like the uniqueness of it. I don't do gaming and use my monitor primarily to read ebooks, surf the Internet and watch videos. This is the perfect size for those tasks. I previously used flatscreen TVs as monitors and decided, for whatever reason, to buy an actual monitor and I am not disappointed.

My only reservation is that because I've been so used to using TVs as monitors for so many years, I'd grown accustomed to having a remote control. So I miss having a remote control. But I've realized that I don't need a remote and that having one was really an eccentric luxury. Another thing I miss is that I cannot cast from my iPhone or iPad to this monitor, which is what I did regularly with my previous TVs/monitors. I suppose that the only solution would have been to buy a smart TV monitor. But again, as with the remote, I've discovered that casting from my iPhone and iPad was another superfluous luxury. In sum, overall, I am completely satisfied with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have any particular inclination for gaming that requires a high-end graphics card.

Finally, after reading some of the user manual, I discovered that to support higher resolutions and refresh rates, it's better to use a display port 1.2 cable (like this one on Amazon: ""Amazon Basics DisplayPort 1.2 Cable, 21.6Gbps High-Speed, 4K@60Hz, 2K@165Hz, Gold-Plated Plugs, 6 Foot, Black"") rather than an HDMI cable to connect the monitor to a computer.",8,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

And even most recently I've had top of the line Ultra Wides like the Samsung Oddysey G9 49"" 5120x1440. I've also tried large 4K monitors at 43"" and multiple 4k screens at 27"".

1440p just isn't enough vertical pixels anymore for productivity workflows as a software egineer and 1080 definitely is not enough. And because 16:9 is still the standard panel size most ultrawides adopt a variation of that. 32:9 5120X1440 is basically just two 2560x1440 panels spliced together in one screen. And there are NO 32:9 7680x2160 ultra wides yet, they don't exist.

Furthermore with a large resolution like 4k I've found that 1 43"" screen is too big to be that close to me unless it's curved at 1800R (doesn't exist). And 27"" is too small at 4k things are too tiny.

32"" is the sweet spot for me for a 4k screen, it's PERFECT, it fits perfectly in my field of view in front of me on my desk looking straight on and I don't need to move my head to see anything on it. Furthermore putting it at 125% OS Scale perfects it, still 4k in games, legible out of games (not too small) and that zoom rate at 4k is near perfect for writing code.

So I've opted to get 3 of these screens instead of a low resolution ultra wide. And I will spend less for all 3 of these than 1 lower resolution ultra wide, really what's not to love about that?

The picture looks great too and it supports HDR. The only knock I would give it for gaming is that it's only 60hz, but for work that's perfectly fine.

However, Dell, if you're reading this, PLEASE make a DP 2.1 7680X2400 Ultra Wide (even if Alienware) it would be the perfect monitor for both gaming and work. It would be 32:10 Aspect ratio (16:10 is far superior to 16:9) and it would be 2 4k 16:10 screens in one display. It would destroy all the competition.",31,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

Changing the color profile to RTS did not mitigate it, nor is changing it to any other profile (both on the monitor or in the Mac System Settings) . This appears to be a common issue with Apple's M1 chips and 4K external monitors (there are plenty of threads about this). I did not know about this prior to buying this monitor and I could not find a definite solution for this.
I did not have this issue when I had a 2K monitor with my M1 Macbook, both Dell U and S series 27 inch 2k monitor, and a Viotek Ultrawide 2K monitor also.
I'm still debating if I should return this or not and downgrade back to a 2K monitor.
I'm leaving it to 5 stars since it's not the monitor's fault, it's the M1 chip.

Just a few notes/tips:
- I downloaded the BetterDisplay App for the Mac. The license is only $15 and I've applied the license to two separate M1 macbooks with no problem. This allows you to enable native resolution scaling, which helps with the scaled resolution clarity somewhat, along with additional fine tuning configs.
If you don't know, Apple has scaling issues with 4k Monitors, refer to YouTube videos for more info.
- Setting the color profile to Generic RGB Profile really makes the color pop and the darks darker. So making it closer to the Macbook's native color vibrancy. This is set in the System Settings > Displays > Select the Dell S3221QS > Set color Profile to Generic RGB Profile (of course you can try out the other profiles too).
- Setting the response time to 'Extreme' should reduce ghosting (Just found this in some YouTube video)

------ Previous Review ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sharp display for coding. I’m a software engineer. I initially made a mistake of purchasing a 2K 32 inch monitor. The text was somewhat pixelated, I knew it would cause eventual eye fatigue. Then, I picked this one up and the texts are very sharp even at 3008x1692 resolution (higher than 2k, less than 4K) which offers more screen real estate than 1440p. I’m happy with it.
All I care about is the text sharpness, I don’t play video games nor do I do any kind of video/photo editing, so I can’t comment about the vibrancy and/or color accuracy.

Only con I found is that with the standard preset mode, I saw that the backlight flickers when scrolling rapidly through some webpages. But once I changed it to RTS, it went away. Idk, maybe it’s a specific issue with my monitor (I purchased it used).

Anyways, no regrets. And to think I was considering picking up the Apple Studio display. Definitely saved me some funds 👌🏽",41,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

As for the picture, I have it connected to a Mac Mini via HDMI and the picture is gorgeous. No bad pixels, color is vivid and I love the curved screen - it feels so luxurious. My wife said it is too big, like sitting in the front row at the movies, but it is not like that. It just wraps around with a beautiful picture. Although it can do a screen resolution of up to 3840 x 2160, for most applications I use 1920 x 1080. Setting it to the higher resolutions makes the print harder to read although it sure does allow for seeing a huge portion of Excel spreadsheets! I set it to the higher resolutions when watching videos and they're clear and sharp.

Pros:
1) Perfect size with a 1.25x zoom for having two windows side-by-side with enough room to see a 2-pane code diff on each.
2) Comes out of sleep much faster than Dell monitors from the early 2010's, and provides faster automatic switching for a dual-input setup.
3) The curvature helps to bring the left and right edges a little closer without having to physically shift your head left or right.
4) The monitor doesn't get too hot, compared to previous 4k monitors I've used.

Cons:
1) If part of the screen is very light, and another part very dark (e.g., two browsers side-by-side, one with a white background and the other with black), then the light portions will (under some circumstances) get very washed-out (low contrast) and sometimes be a little hard to read. I see this as a somewhat critical flaw for many, but for my workflow, I keep all windows with a light background so I don't encounter this issue in practice.
2) Pixels disappear close to the left and right edges due to viewing angle. For my workflow, it's not enough pixels to worry about, but if there was a single-pixel wide border, this would disappear at most viewing angles.
3) I've had a monitor for about a month, and had a single instance so far when the monitor momentarily turned black. I've seen this with previous 4k monitors, and suspect that this problem is due to either cable quality. Overall, this is a low-rate for this problem, so I'm currently optimistic that it won't become a problem.

Overall, this is the best monitor I've ever owned. I briefly tried an ultra-wide monitor (34"" 3440x1440 with 160 Hz refresh), but returned it because the text was too pixellated (it was running with no zoom) and because it was too wide, but not tall enough. That monitor was amazing for gaming, but since I spend much more time doing software development, that doesn't matter as much.",56,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

The rounded power button on the bottom-right has a pleasant light touch and good tactile feedback, with a downward-facing LED which is visible without burning a hole in your retina. The adjacent menu buttons however are a bit awkward and less pleasant to use. I recommend installing the Dell Display Manager software to control frequently-changed settings like brightness, but it unfortunately does not support all of the monitor's settings (e.g. RGB controls).

The image is bright, with only minor color variation across the screen. The brightness control works well across the full range from 0 to 100%. There is a sharpness control which I found must be set no higher than 50% to prevent some text from appearing faint due to being drawn with only 1-pixel thickness.

Grays are displayed with a brownish tint, a problem that seems common among VA panels.

The 1800R curve is less curved than the more common 1500R competitors. I would prefer 1500R or even 1000R, as I sit close to the screen.

Using the provided HDMI cable, I was able to achieve only a 30Hz refresh rate at the native resolution. I was shocked that the cable came tightly folded with very sharp 180-degree bends which can deform the insulation and degrade the transmission characteristics. I was able to achieve the full rated 60Hz after replacing the cable.",2,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

That's because this still fits my required needs for the money I spent on it. It's VESA mountable, has interior speakers, can switch between 2 HDMI signals, and can supposedly do 4k at 60 hertz. Right now, I just need it as a second monitor with decent to good display quality for work and some light gaming. So this was a good fit for me. BUT...

Other potential buyers should know they may run into issues getting this monitor to display at 4k 60 hertz as advertised. At first, I thought it was the HDMI cable they provided since from my testing and after seeing some other reviews I had believed it to be an older version of HDMI, but when I switched out the cable with a newly bought HDMI 2.1 cable, no luck. I can only get 4K at 30 hertz or 1080 at 60 hertz. (However, this might just be an issue with my computer and not necessarily the monitor's fault. My computer is the Lenovo Yoga A940 (27) All-in-One) When hooking the monitor up to my old Xbox one (yes, the original 2013 one), I was given a notice by the console the frame rate would jump up on any games the console could handle but that doesn't confirm it will run as advertised with the series X either (Sadly I don't have one yet because of damn scalpers). So I'd suggest exercising some caution if you're buying this monitor in the hopes you can just plug it into anything and have it run at 4k 60 hertz. Given other reviews, I'm sure the monitor can manage to do it... But it might not be as easy as plugging it in and having it work right away.

As far as work and gaming quality is concerned, the images are sharp. This is the biggest monitor I've ever owned thus far and it's nice to have plenty of space for different browsing windows or open applications. The monitor gets bright enough and seems to offer enough color contrast to not overall affect my experience when sitting near a window (Please note I'm not directly facing the sun, however). I've waited over one month to write this review and so far I've had no issues with the monitor beside the one I mentioned. So I like the monitor. However, this monitor might not work for you if you're depending on a concise 4k 60 hertz output as soon as you plug it in.",2,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

TL;DR : If you are buying this just to surf the web and watch videos, stop here and buy it. For its price, its a bargain. But if you are doing video or picture editing, office work (especially in a dark environment), or really CARE about video quality, I would definitely think twice before buying... (Not going to do a full review here, as many have, and except for the picture quality, the positive ones are mostly correct)

The only real issues I have with the S3221QS in a professional environment are :

1) Monitor Brightness : This unit has just a paltry 300 nits of brightness, well below most monitors, and even when connected via DP at 4K / 4:4:4 / 10 Bit / Maximum Brightness + Contrast, it still looks way dim, as compared to my existing Dell (see pictures above, the SQ3221QS is on the right side, and the U3014 is on the left). And using the S3221QS's HDR Settings did absolutely nothing to change this... I did not attempt to see if playing games or watching videos would change anything, however, and even though I am pretty good at calibrating monitors, and played with various adjustments for over one hour, no joy.

2) Video Clarity / Video Accuracy : One cannot expect a $450 monitor to compare with a $1200 monitor, but given my Dell U3014 is over 10 years old, and has a lower resolution (2560x1600) and lower bit depth (8bit vs 10bit), one might hope as much. Not ! As you can see in the photos above, comparing the side by side pictures, the clouds on the S3221QS (on right) are yellowish, the blue sky is oversaturated, and most importantly, the image resolution on the far right ""mountain"" is dull, unfocused, and lacking in detail and color, as compared to the U3014 image on the left.. And no amount of playing with gamma, colors, contrast or brightness changed any of this. I even brought down the S3221QS resolution to 2560x1440 to make a additional comparison, and zero change.

Long story short, if you have a highly-rated older Dell UltraSharp, and expecting a cheaper or modern 4K VA panel to match or exceed it in overall image quality, it is just not going happen, however much you want it to... Boxing this unit up now and returning to Amazon, and looking at the Dell U3223QE to replace it, which has a IPS panel and 400nits brightness, but costs around $900 direct from Dell, or around $700 if you buy it on sites like eBay.. (Amazon is asking $1000 + at this time). And you don't mind the slightly larger bezels and lower QHD resolution on the U3014, they can be picked up in excellent used condition for under $300..

When connected in this way the monitor would intermittently awake from sleep to inform me that there was ""no signal"", very annoying, and even more than annoying are the severe video glitches - shimmering and ghosting effects that required LCD reconditioning to resolve. I had the same cabling set up from the Mac to a separate LG monitor without either of these issues, so it's for sure something to do with the Dell monitor not liking the DP signal send out from the Mac (and/or, something about the type of cable that Dell specifically does not like). Running a cable from Mac USB-C to Dell HDMI takes care of both issues, but since this Dell monitor very sadly does not support PIP/PBP for 2 HDMI sources, and it is very difficult to run an HDMI source into a DisplayPort connector, this means PIP/PBP is basically no-go on Mac.

In the monitor menu, there is an HDR display mode for both movies and games, but that is as far as HDR support goes with this monitor. Note, if you select an HDR mode in the monitor menu, it does allow you to select HDR in Windows display settings. The monitor purports to have the minimum brightness level (300 nits) for HDR content, but my experience is that 400 nits or more is really required if you want decent HDR content display. There is some HDR support on this monitor but it is marginal.

On the positive side, it has dual HDMI inputs and a Display Port input as well as a 2-port USB 3.0 hub.

I like the curved monitor look, but I prefer 1500R on a monitor of this size rather than the 1800R curvature of this monitor. Still, 1800R provides better viewing than flat at this size and it is acceptable.

The Dell Display Manager software works well for segmenting the display into a variety of different content windows.

All-in all it is a solid large-screen curved monitor if a true HDR display is not a primary need. If you need true HDR support, look for a monitor with an HDR10 rating compliance.

For the price, this is an excellent 4K monitor and ticks all the boxes for me except true HDR support (not likely to be found in this price range for a monitor of this size).",14,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

I do some photography on the side, and I've found the color replication to solid, at least for my eyes--others who do videography and photography professionally would know more than me.

I wish the manual controls were more customizable. To change inputs, it requires several button clicks to get to the proper menu. I wish there was a dedicated input button. The PIP function works, but you can't use both HDMI ports for it; you have to use HDMI and DisplayPort. Also, and I don't know if this is a standard function elsewhere, only one stream of audio comes through with the PIP. I'd prefer both, but I don't know if that's a reasonable request.

I ordered a very good condition used monitor from Amazon Warehouse and sent it back--there were a few dead pixels, and one of the HDMI ports would cut in and out randomly (I tried several cables and devices). When I purchased a new model, I had the same problem with an HDMI port (again, trying several cables and devices). Since I'm able to use the DisplayPort, and I have an HDMI switch for my computers, I decided to keep it rather than return it. But that's a warning; if this is a common quality control issue, you might have an HDMI issue.

I use external speakers so I can't speak for the monitor sound quality. Haven't used the VESA mount, either. The stand is somewhat bulky at the bottom, but it is covered by my soundbar so it isn't an issue. The bezel isn't as minimal as other models in the price point, but it doesn't bother me.

As for viewing angles, the screen seems matte to my eyes, so I don't get much glare. Extreme angles cause distortion, but it's a curved monitor so that's to be expected.

For cable management, it doesn't do a great job of hiding things, but I don't need that for my desk.

Had a horrible flickering and reddish tinge. That's Amazon's fault, not Dell's. The replacement was brand new and worked perfectly.

For this price point, you only get a 60Hz refresh rate, and that's just the way it is. I do wish it had a faster refresh rate, perhaps 75Hz would be nice, but again, the competition here is also only 60Hz, so really not a complaint. Besides, a GPU powerful enough to do modern games in 4K resolution is expensive - so if you can afford a video card that can do high refresh rate gaming at 4K, you're probably willing to spend 3x as much on a monitor.

I have always liked Dell monitors, this in fact replaces two 1080P Dell monitors. Just like all the other Dell monitors I've bought, this one had no dead or stuck pixels. It offers a high build quality with a fully adjustable stand that can rotate and go up/down - something some competing monitors lack.

My only gripe is they should include a DisplayPort cable in addition to the HDMI cable. That's why I'm deducting a star. You might think that's harsh, but some of the competing monitors do include a DP cable, so Dell can do it too.",16,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2721QS

I still am not satisfied with this product but I have raised it from 2 to 3 stars for what can be seen below:

After returning the product and spending far too many hours of investigation I believe the biggest issue (Signal Loss) may not have been a defect of this product. HP, Intel, Microsoft & a few other monitor manufacturers have tried to diagnose what could be causing a Signal Loss. I think I accidentally determined what is likely the cause... My laptops power supply/charger. All monitors I have tested are experiencing a Signal Loss unless I unplug the power supply/charger. This may not be the cause of the issue but it certainly appears to be associated with the issue. It is still unknown how/why this is occurring.

Additionally, even when leaving the power supply/charger plugged in and using a TV as an external monitor the TV does not experience a Signal Loss like external PC monitors are. A final conclusion has not been reached at this time but I will provide an update if the cause of the issue has been determined.

ORIGINAL POST:

Had some good Pros but they were overran by the Cons and regardless of your own views on the Pros & Cons the item was also defective.

Main Issue:

Intermittent Signal Loss - About every 5 to 30 seconds the screen would appear as though the HDMI cord had been unplugged. This issue has been reported by many in these reviews and elsewhere on the internet (PS - I used a Windows device not Apple/Mac). As soon as I setup the monitor the issue occurred and Dell Support had no explanation but offered to send an exchange. I might have considered taking that offer IF I had purchased it from Dell directly but seeing as how I purchased it from Amazon I simply processed a refund a couple hours after receiving this product.

Pros:

- An entry price for a 27"" 4k monitor (Awesome price considering the other Pros)
- Audio Output
- Built in speakers
- Could rise/lower
- Could tilt forwards/backwards
- Could swivel

Cons:

- Intermittent Signal Loss!!!
- A black screen only appeared as a black cross directly in front of your eyes, it sort of looked somewhat similar to something like the rest of the screen had clouding (must see video to understand as well as see a signal loss)
- Built in power supply (Makes Monitor bigger, heated & heavier)
- Faded colors contrast
- Menu options appear outdated and while downloading the Dell Monitor App was better it was still outdated",9,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2721QS

I'm running on Windows and scaling at 125%, which helps with font sizes of menus, etc, but still leaves lots of real estate for multiple windows.

I've tried several scaling values, all the way up to 200%, and with each one clarity did not decrease. Impressive.

Colors are vivid and seem pretty accurate. Brightness and contrast are good too. Menu options are decent.

Things I'm not a big fan of: monitor vertical travel is very slight. I'm a short guy and even at max height, I'm going to need to prop up the monitor. So ""fail"" on the monitor stand for that.

May as well not have installed speakers; they are so anemic as to be useless. I just disabled them in the menu.

Also, there is a slight shadow affect near the right edge and right lower corner. It's not super pronounced and if you look at it head on, you can't see it. But from my peripheral vision while looking at the center of the monitor, my eyes register that that area is a bit darker. For all practical purposes this isn't a problem and I'm not going to return the monitor because of it. My guess is that after a couple of days of using it, it won't register at all. Also, if you happen to have a darker wallpaper, you will probably never notice this.

I was hesitant about whether 4k was overkill for a 27"" monitor, and I would now say ""no"". Just a bit of help from Windows scaling and everything is big enough to easily see and still crystal clear. I switched to this monitor from a QHD monitor from Dell that was also clear, but this one beats the clarity by a noticeable amount.

I'm finding that the HDMI ports can be fussy. I've purchased several DisplayLink docs, and none of them can communicated with these monitors via HDMI, but they can communicate via DisplayPort. Also, when connected via HDMI to Dell dock, there's a 20s lag for the monitor to ""come to life"", which does not happen with my other Dell monitors. Something flaky about this monitor and HDMI.

If you are looking to dip your toes into the 4k waters, I'd say this is a respectable place to start!",16,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2721QS

It was connected with the included HDMI to my Mac Studio. I went through every calibration and setting I could find but nothing made it better.

Another factor is unless you are DEAD on in the apex and vertical center of the screen it had this greyish old-monitor with low quality look to it. Just not for me.

Add a weird bit of small flickering and back in the box it went.

The 4K resolution and ultra-thin bezel make for an immersive and striking display, whether I'm working on graphic design projects or immersing myself in the latest games.

The color and contrast are also top-notch, with deep blacks and vibrant colors that really make images pop. The viewing angles are also great, so it's easy to share the screen with others in a group setting.

In terms of value for money, the Dell S2721QS is a bit on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth it if you're looking for a high-quality 4K display.

Pros:

-4K resolution and ultra-thin bezel make for a stunning display
-AMD FreeSync technology for smooth gaming
-VESA certified for easy wall or arm mounting
-Great color and contrast

Waterland,4.0,2021-06-10 00:00:00,美國,,"WARNING: MUST USE DEFAULT RESOLUTION (AT LEAST WITH MAC - macbook pro 13 inch 2020). Read below for more info.

Pros:
1. This monitor is very large and the curved display is great for viewing all areas of the screen without issue. Huge screen space that can very very easily fit two side-by-side windows with great resolution and size.
2. The resolution is crisp and high quality.
3. The appearance is clean and sleek - edges around the display are thin and the monitor base feels well-made, heavy and sturdy.

Cons:
1. I wish the adjustable height went up 1-2 inches more so that I could put my laptop in front of it and use both screens without overlap. I use a 2020 macbook pro 13 inch and the top of my laptop raises about an inch or two above the bottom of the monitor even when monitor is on full height. With a mounted setup, wider desk (my work desk is 30 inches wide), smaller laptop or if you are using a keyboard and CPU instead of laptop, this should not be an issue.
2. You MUST USE THE DEFAULT RESOLUTION instead of a scaled resolution (at least on mac - under system preferences > displays > resolution). It would be easier to use a scaled resolution so that font and window sizes are adjusted appropriately, but scaled resolution results in a NOTICEABLE LAG when moving the mouse, scrolling, zooming in/out, or moving windows around. Using default resolution and then adjusting font sizes works and the lag goes away.
3. The display color is slightly ashier/gray compared to my mac laptop display. See picture attached. The same desktop image just looks less vivid on the external monitor. I don't find this to be a huge issue as I'll mostly use the monitor for programming work (the reduced vividness is not noticeable unless looking at two identical images) but it may be an issue for someone in a design field or similar who needs a really color accurate monitor.",36,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

Colors and contrast are also not great, but I didn't expect more for the price. Again, it's good value.

The main issue I have is that around the time the one-year warranty expires, these monitors show panel degradation at the borders and the image gets discolored. This is visible mostly in he corners and gets larger over time (I took a picture) This seems to be a series issue and not an issue with my particular model since all three of the monitors I have show the same issue.

Pro: Overall, I love them! It is nice that when I move my head, the distance from my eyes to the screens is roughly the same, no matter which screen I'm looking at.

Con:
1) One monitor had 25 DOA pixels in a single group. Thus I returned it without any issues and ordered me a replacement.

2) The monitor stands aren't as tall as my old Dell monitors, so I had to use 4 of my old college textbooks (at least they are good for something now) and added a few slats of wood to get them to the correct height I needed, as you can see in the image.

3) If you are a Graphic Designer or do GUI layout design, the curved screen will play tricks on you. Look at the image to see how the browser's title bar and footer look unnaturally curved.",10,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

Really well made budget 4K display, with a few detractors. Firstly I did get a panel with a stuck red pixel; which has never gone away despite a few trying recommended techniques to get rid of it. It is only noticeable in really dark images, its just a speck with such fine pixels. It wasn't worth the risks that come with return/exchange of getting something worse.

There is some issue with ghosting and traces with darker images in gaming, but not bad for a general use monitor. I did encounter some image retention with bright, fullscreen patterns persisting for 30 minutes; but was resolved with the built-in tool after about 10 minutes.
That points to a manufacturing quality flaw; impurities in the liquid crystals: Display Uniformity issues leading to Parasitic Capacitance or a Charge Buildup. A Screensaver that have random patterns and colors can help dissipate that excess charge.

Built-in speaker(s) sound pretty weak; just awful really. Sounds like a phone speaker in a plastic box.

The Good
Latency is very good compared to other monitors I've owned. Color can be very accurate with a little bit of tuning. The antiglare coating or treatment works well without being noticeable. The display is generally bright enough to use in a well-lit room. Upscales 1080p content fairly well. HDR and FreeSync is just okay on this monitor; but is what I expected for the price.

The stand is really adjustable, and is surprisingly stable/balanced. The plastic seems pretty high quality, with the exception of the front bezel.

Got it on sale for a bargain price. Less than some 2k or even 1080p displays this size (27"")",4,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2721QS

I'm using a Mac Mini M2 Pro. In certain situations the screen flickers. I switched the cable from HDMi to USBC → Display Port which helped a bit. You get more resolution options with the USBC cable. However you sacrifice a USBC port to go that route.

Here are two ways to recreate the issue:

1. Set your background to a solid light color. Open a webpage in Chrome, when you hover over certain links the screen will flicker.

2. With your background still set to a light color, open the Launchpad. The screen will flicker.

Oddly enough if you set the background to a picture, there is no flicker. I have only had it a couple of days so I will try to update if anything changes.

Your screen fonts will be blurry if you use the HDMI cable that comes in the box. There are several available under $15 on Amazon. Connect directly to a USB-C port on your Mac since a hub may downgrade the video signal quality.

Actually, I had started the return process for the monitor after spending an hour trying to fix the blurry font issue. Spend an hour with both Amazon and DELL product support on phone to no avail. DELL declared the monitor defective and suggested a return. However, I decided to give one last try with a USB-C to DP cable, and voila, the fonts became crisp and the refresh rate was full @60Hz. With this small change, now this monitor became a keeper :)

Initially, I had some reservations about the curved monitors but with 24 hours of usage, that adjustment curve has passed and I feel that I will now never go back to flat screens.

I use it for software development and for typical home office use. This monitor fits the bill. No comments for the gaming usage.

The only missing thing is the USB ports with PD, It's shame why DELL didn't think about the Mac platform users.

I use it as part of a multi-monitor setup where one monitor is in landscape mode and the Dell S2721QS 27 inch is in portrait mode. The thin bezels on both these Dell monitors means the screen gap between the two is negligible and I can operate without even noticing. Excellent.

BUT after 6 months or so the Dell S2721QS 27inch started automatically jumping into it's own settings controls without me initiating the action. My guess is this is because being in portrait mode was not one of the designed-for use cases and the impacts of gravity over time on the switches (little nubby things on the outer frame - see red circled area on third image) were unanticipated.

In any case, it's very annoying to have this happen constantly. It's like having a notification you didn't sign up for pop onto your screen every 3 to 5 minutes ALL DAY. You can ignore it and it goes away, but it comes back reliably. SUPER ANNOYING.

I've tried everything to remedy this. New power cable, new HDMI cable, new USB hub. My boyfriend does this for a living and couldn't fix it. I even got tech support to send me a replacement. They ALL have this issue, so I'm fairly sure it's due to incompatibility with the laptops / Windows OS.

My advice would be to buy it from a place with a liberal return policy. Use it heavily during the return window and SHIP IT BACK ASAP if it glitches. There is NO remedying this issue once it happens.

They look great and the screen is fantastic. The monitors are used for work as well as for personal use. For work, the ComfortView mode is very helpful.

Well, I quickly noticed the HDMI cable these monitors come with are labeled High speed HDMI cables (yes really) with Ethernet. High speed HDMI cables support 4k@30Hz. I have never bought a product where the HDMI cables did not fully support the specs of the device. It would be like buying a PS5 or a Sonos soundbar and it didn't include the right HDMI cable. It seems so absurd and laughable that they would include an HDMI 1.4 cable in this day and age with a monitor that support 4k@60Hz. It's ridiculous, no way around it. I bought Vesa certified display port cables and they are working great with these monitors. And no more issues with my docking station. For the record, the original HDMI 1.4 cables did seem to work with a single monitor setup at 60Hz but this type of cable is still not supported for this type of monitor.

For work, the monitor is great. I can manage multiple windows (a browser or two, a text editor, and a multi-pane terminal) with the monitor set back 2-3 feet with UI scaling to 125%-150% and maintain absolute clarity and legibility. The text clarity, color accuracy, and contrast is brilliant when compared to my previous TN panel monitor. I don't think I'll ever go back to a TN.

BUT the motion blurring is atrocious. After some research, I believe this is due to pixel response time, and apparently this monitor has awful pixel response time. It's noticeable with text ghosting, but it becomes unbearable in games if you're used to even middle-of-the-road responsiveness. You'll notice it especially for any rapid dark-to-light transitions. Now, I'm not a serious gamer so I wasn't turned off by reviews mentioning that the 60Hz refresh rate might not be acceptable to ""competitive"" ""gamers"". I do, however, care about the clarity of moving images. There is, after all, a ""video"" component to ""video games"". And I don't want it to hurt my eyes. G-Sync works fine with the monitor's FreeSync, so at least you won't be subjected to any screen-tearing to distract you from the poor response time.

FURTHERMORE, I wasn't able to stream HDR content from Netflix or Amazon Prime at all. I knew HDR performance was lacking with this monitor but I didn't expect it to not even work. You can technically put the monitor in HDR mode and it'll work for HDR YouTube content. It'll work in games if you can figure out how to reduce the max brightness and paper white in a game's settings to match the paltry specifications of the monitor. However, I was unable to and the end result is that games played in HDR looked worse than SDR, especially for scenes set at night or in shadows.

I spent over a week researching monitors and was excited to get the Dell S3221QS. It's been such a disappointment to use.

(If you're interested in how I was able to determine my problem with this monitor is response time and not refresh rate, I ran a control test with my PC hooked up to my 4k TV with fps locked at 60 to provide a simulation of 60Hz. Surprisingly, my TV has much less blur than this monitor.)",5,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

I ordered 2 separately, one arrived earlier and the box wasn't even sealed, it probably due to the deliveryman torn the tape off when carrying it. I immediately checked the item to see if the the panel was damaged or missing parts. Fortunately I did not find any physical damage, but the picture quality disappointed me hugely. Because it's a VA panel, which has narrower viewing angle compares to IPS panel, even it's curved I can still feel on the side of the monitor everything looks faded and blurry. I really tried to get to it, but I ended up having to lean towards the area so I can see clearer.

It might be OK if you are not a heavy PC user like me, who stares at the screen over 8h a day. It works fine when watching videos, especially from a little bit distance, but I find very struggle to use this monitor to look at code. I tried scale it to 125% and 150%, still the characters are not as crisp as I used to. everything looks like seeing through a very fine foggy glass, and gets worse when towards to the edges.

overall, If you are buying a monitor for leisure use, probably 2 to 3h a day watching youtube videos, this will be a good size monitor at budget. but if you are buying monitor for office work use, avoid any VA panel monitors, go for the IPS monitors.",4,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3221QS

Aguilar,3.0,2022-03-25 00:00:00,美國,,"Up front: I purchased this new but in a damaged box, so got it with a greatly discounted price, so I'm not going to return it. Overall it's a fantastic monitor and I have no regrets about purchasing it (again, for the discounted price).

The cons are concerning, though. There are two DESIGN FLAWS to highlight here, specifically:

1. The speakers will intermittently emit a high-pitched whining sound, or a mid-range electrical buzzing sound, throughout the day. The ONLY way to get rid of it it to turn the volume on the monitor all the way down (like, to zero). Even at ""1"", you'll hear it. I've gone online and learned this is inherent to the model, not specific to the monitor I received.

2. The menu buttons on the bottom of the monitor are poorly located, and hard to push/engage (except for the power button). To access a menu, you have to really jam up to engage them, and because they are located on the outer edge of the monitor the entire monitor tilts every time you do that. Because I have two computers cabling in, I often switch back and forth, and I'll tell you, it's bothersome and effortful to get to the menu option needed to do that.

Other than those two concerns, I'm very happy. And again, given that I got this at a discounted price, I'll keep it. But if I had to do it all over again I'd probably research and purchase a different brand/model.",16,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DW

Hernandez,4.0,2020-10-07 00:00:00,美國,,"I bought the 27"" adjustable stand model of this and so far I love it. The text looks super crisp and it has a vesa mount for when I can get some monitor arms hooked up to it. I didn't have any issues using it with my MBP at all. One caveat I learned, and this is super minor, is that if you want to use the PIP (picture in picture) or PBP (picture by picture) it appears you need one input to be HDMI and the other HAS to be display port. I have my PS4 and MBP hooked up to the two HDMI ports and I can't use this feature. My solution was to buy a USB-C to Display port cable for my MBP output and I have yet to try that out. I can still easily toggle between the two inputs using the two HDMI ports, so that's nice. I was mostly interested in seeing how the PIP or PBP looks.

Other comments have mentioned that the stand doesn't pivot left/right, but that's not true. Mine does on the ""adjustable"" style.

UPDATE: I hooked up a USBC to display port cable from my MacBook and then used the hdmi cable from my ps4 and was able to do picture in picture and side by side. Its cool, but not very practical on a 27"" screen.",51,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2721QS

- VESA compliant. I was able to connect it to my multi-screen stand.
- Decent speaker. I am surprised it has a good enough low-frequency response.
- Dual HDMI input.
- Picture in Picture and Picture by Picture (PbP)

Cons:
- It's not HDR10 monitor. The black/darkness is awful
- Weaker contrast than I expected. Even though I set the contrast to 100%, my laptop's screen (4k) has better contrast than the monitor (which was connected to the laptop as extra screen). the contrast ratio is 3000:1 and luminance 300 cd/m2
- It's based on older screen technology (the specs in the user guide says it's an Active matrix-TFT LCD). I think it's misleading for Dell to advertise it as LED (same thing as shown on Amazon). Yes, it uses LED edge light backlighting, but that's not a real LED screen.

Upon entering the product's number on the Dell website, it stated that the warranty was good on a date that was only 8 months from the day I received the item. After conversations with Dell, this is what I learned:

First, the monitor's warranty was one year; not all Dell monitors have a three year warranty! This was neither obvious, nor easy to get my hands on.

Secondly, and more concerning, when one buys a Dell product from amazon, the warranty on the monitor started when the monitor left Dell! So, if a Dell product is held in inventory elsewhere, the warranty will start NOT from when you buy it, but from when the reseller RECEIVED it from Dell.

So, in effect, I had 9 months of warranty on a Dell product that I received.

I decided to give this $300 Dell a try. Frankly, I am blown away. Next to my Macbook Pro XDR display, this looks just a smooth and detailed to me with good contrast as Apple’s high-end monitor. Every app icon and the curves around typography are luscious. Images are well saturated and lively. It’s hard to believe it’s not 5K, though for some reason System Profiler does report it as a 5K monitor. It also says it’s only 300 nits of brightness but it looks as bright as my 500 nit MacBook Pro display. This is certainly better than the Samsung I have at work, which always seems washed out and bland no matter how I play with the calibration settings.

The caveats are solely with everything besides the panel. The USB hub has only two ports, one of which is awkwardly on the bottom of the monitor, which would be great for a keyboard and nothing else. And you must choose between High Data Rate or High Resolution modes. At High Data Rate, I get about 145 mbps through a hard drive, but I can see some banding on gradient tests. On High Resolution, I only get 35 mbps through the hard disk, but the banding test looks perfect. The idea that I would easily plug two hard drives into here is not going to happen.
There’s also an annoying light on the bottom I have to put some tape over. There’s a setting to turn it off when the monitor is on, but it’s always on when the monitor is in standby. The rest of the electronics world has stopped putting obnoxious, unnecessary LEDs on everything, and Dell needs to get with the program.
Speaking of standby, the monitor shows a series of three error messages when you put the computer to sleep. This monitor needs to chill out and go with the flow. If the computer is turned off it should also go off without complaint.
The stand is a tad bit wobbly and could be better.
Don’t bother with the speaker—it’s terrible.
The OSD menus are long and complicated. On Apple displays you just plug them in and they work without any OSD. I feel like a monitor should just display things accurately and shouldn’t need to be configured.
I recommend the MonitorControl app for Mac to seamlessly change the brightness. Others recommend Lunar, but it’s far too complex.

In sum, it’s not perfect but it’s surprisingly great for $300, the price of just the inferior matte coating on a Studio Display.

I bought this monitor 6 weeks ago to replace an aging 24"" Dell monitor that had served me very well. But 4K monitors have been getting better and coming down in price, so it was time to upgrade.

Last fall, I bought the more expensive Dell U2720QM monitor for my office at work. That one cost about $550 (and often cannot be found for less than $650). This one, the Dell S2722QC, costs about $380. I will be comparing them in this review, and - spoiler alert - this monitor, the QC, is pretty much just as good as the more expensive QM.

Both the QC and QM models are 27"", 4K, have nice bright screens, and accurate vivid colors right out of the box.

Both have wonderfully adjustable stands: there's the usual tilt & swivel, and you can slide the screen up to a higher position (useful if the screen is plugged into a laptop and the laptop is directly in front of the screen on your desk) or to a very low position where the bottom of the monitor is an inch from the surface of your desk. But the really cool thing is that stand (for BOTH monitors) allows you to rotate the screen 90 degrees so it's in portrait mode. That's really helpful for some of my use-cases. It's also useful to help you see the ports on the bottom edge of the display, when you're plugging in cables - otherwise they're hard to see when you're trying to plug something in.

Both of these monitors can replace a USB-C hub. Meaning, you can plug in several peripherals into the monitor and connect the monitor to your computer using just a single USB-C cable. Your computer will get power from the monitor over the same USB-C cable that your computer uses to transmit data to the monitor. And your computer will see all the peripherals that are connected to the monitor as if they were connected directly to your computer.

These USB-C hubs are godsends for people with laptops that only have 1 or 2 or 3 USB-C ports. For this reason, I have used USB-C hubs for my offices at home and work; they're not cheap, but they're worth it for me.

But the USB-C hubs take up desk space and have some cord clutter. With the Dell monitors, I don't need the USB-C hubs any more. I donated one to my college and the other to a local church. Both Dell monitors have enough ports for me to plug in my printer, my external hi-fi speakers, my external web-cam for Zoom & FaceTime calls, and an external SSD hard drive.

So why does the Dell U2720QM cost so much more than this Dell S2722QC? Well, the QM has one or two more ports (for the USB-C hub functionality) than this QC model. And, on paper, the QM seems to have a slightly better display, according to specs. But I have both, and I can't tell a difference in video quality. Probably people who do a ton of photo and video editing could, but I have good eyes and I can't tell the difference, and I don't think most people will see enough of a difference to justify spending $200 more for the QM model.

Oh, here's one more difference: the cheaper QC model has built-in speakers, the more expensive QM model does not. I have to say, I really dislike the sound that comes from the speakers in the QC monitor; it is very very thin and tinny sounding, almost to the point of being shrill and annoying. My laptop speakers (which are not great) sound way better.

And that's a shame, because if you're feeding video into the QC monitor from HDMI (for example if you plug a blu-ray player into the HDMI port), the audio goes in over the same cable, so the monitor really needs to have its own speakers otherwise it's difficult to find a way to hear the sound.

Bottom line: for most people, this $380 QC model is every bit as good as the QM model that costs $550 or $650 or more, even though both have a gorgeous 27"" 4K display and both have very useful USB-C hub functionality. And the stand's flexibility is really useful.

Now - this may work well for movies or for gaming, however, I have just not used for that purpose so not in position to comment on it.

My Setup:
I am using this over VESA mount (100mm x 100mm). My VESA mount have weight capacity of 15 lbs and this holds very well with it.

Features:
USB Functionalities ---
USB-C port is being used to connect to my Macbook Pro. What is the good thing? It is charging as well as display. Compared to my old setup, I was able to get rid of ""Dongle"" to hook up HDMI and charger separate and now my table is pretty clean.

Other USB ports are also connected to the ""hub"" - implies I can use my drawing tablet to the USB port (it is NOT USB-C) is connected with the monitor always and I can use as soon as plugin mac to the monitor. This is very good because my desk is almost clutter free now!

My macbook was able to detect this monitor and setup was really breeze.

Power Saving ---
When Macbook is closed down or disconnected, it auto powers off. Yeah, I know this may not be big deal - but to me it was. I do not have to touch practically monitor to do anything after installation!

Color Quality ---
I am not pro in this department. However, I find it pretty good color compatibility with the Macbook's original screen.

Night Time ---
Night time feature is something I have not tinkered with. I would love to run this a bit yellowish while I work in the evening time. It is in my TODO list - especially I would want to use if I have to be with screen after 6:30 PM.

Speaker ---
I used headphones the most time, I have not heard anything from the speaker when headphone is not connected. I am not sure if required HDMI or works with USB-C as well.

Wishlist ---
I wish this computer had 2 or 3 USB ports on the left side instead of just one. Also, in terms of real estate, would be nice to distribute USBs across sides so that all cable (does not come from one side).

Overall ---
I am pretty pleased with this purchase. I was able to upgrade from FHD to 4K with USB-C hub - get more ""real estate"" as well as work seamlessly with the Macbook pro. I upgraded myself from Samsung HD2333HD to this one.

I have chosen after going through many many monitors configuration and reviews. This one was in the best location in the triangle of price, features and quality. Of course - spending $200 more would get much better monitor, if I had required better sRGB % - this would not be the best.

If you happen to be in the similar situation like I did - I would recommend others to give this a chance.",22,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722QC

This monitor is replacing a 13 year old HP 2310M which is still working well, just time for an upgrade. I had a bunch of Amazon gift cards after the holidays and my birthday and started researching monitors. In the many years since I last purchased a monitor it appears a LOT has changed...starting with the fact that for the first time ever it looked like I wasn't going to purchase a new HP, and likely LG or Dell were going to be my front runners for a new 4K. Not being a gamer even during the height of the pandemic, my display is for web sufing, mild photo editing, emails, YouTube and an occasional movie, and it looked like a 27 inch was perfect for my needs moving up from a 24 inch unit.

Humongous box arrives (and was not even taped....shame on you Amazon) but luckily everything was well wrapped and intact and the monitor was extremely easy to set up. Since I am using an almost brand new Windows 11 laptop, I hooked up through the provided USB-C cable, plugged a small ethernet adapter hub with three ports into a USB 3.0 port and fired it up. Beautiful color even in my home office which sits in front of windows and doesn't appear washed out. I know the high tech folks like to play around with all of the controls and recalibrate everything, but for a normal person, it is pretty much a plug and play scenario which just works out of the box. As a real plus, I had hope that with the monitor having a USB-C port that my ethernet adapter was also going to work in one of the USB 3.0 ports but had read a couple of reviews that said it did not or would not...wrong...mine works perfectly and I'm getting full gig speed. I'm using bluetooth to connect my mechanical keyboard and mouse, so the set up for me is USB-C from the monitor to my laptop with a single cable to power everything...my ethernet adapter hub is in the rear port next to the USB-C connection and has a single port on its hub connected to power my monitor light bar. So in essence everything is powered through a single cable and I still have the open USB 3.0 port toward the front of the monitor to charge my phone, as well a couple of open ports on the ethernet hub if I need to switch over to wireless for my keyboard or mouse.

I've used pretty extensively over the last week and have seen no signs of flickering, burn in or edge bleeding as others have reported. So all in all, after doing a ton of research and trying things out for the last week, I believe I have found a winner for my needs. To sweeten the pot, I managed to get it on sale for $299 and after using my gift cards ending up paying $0 for the monitor! Score!!!",25,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722QC

The style is rather chic and elegant, although the stand does make the monitor wobble a wee bit. Make sure to assemble it very tightly.

Although everything is painted plastic, like other monitors from other brands, this is very well built. OSD isn't gret but it is easy enough to use.

Big surprise for me was the speakers. They are pretty great. They do sound fairly bass-lacking but they get loud enough for video calls, and they don't sound bad at all, I really like them.",19,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722QC

Pearson,4.0,2022-11-12 00:00:00,美國,,"I'm reviewing this monitor after about six weeks of use.

Good
- Wonderfully sharp display quality makes text and images crisp and easy on the eyes.
- Gets really bright, which helps those of us with aging eyes see small text better.
- Color quality is decent for office work.
- Really nice to plug in one cable that provides all the device connections and powers the laptop. USB-C hub works great with laptops that support power delivery over a USB-C connection, such as the 2020 MacBook Pro and Surface Laptop Studio (at slower 65W charge speed).
- Stand allows perfect height adjustment for comfortable all-day use.
- Can charge phones and other devices with USB-A port under monitor, even when display is off.
- Draws less energy and produces less heat than older flat panel monitors that used fluorescent backlighting.

Not So Good
- The stand, while beautiful, is wobbly. This makes the monitor and a camera sitting on the top of the monitor wobble. Shake is noticeable to those you're broadcasting to during a video call. Thankfully, the stand can be replaced.
- Display has some viewing angle issues making left and right edges appear slightly dimmer than the rest of screen. About a two-inch strip noticeable on both sides. This is not unusual for IPS monitors, but is a little more noticeable with this monitor compared to others I own.

I'm a long time Dell monitor user--bought first in 2008 (still in use in my household). I appreciate their quality, features, and price point. I purchased this monitor to replace a 7-year-old Dell P2715Q monitor. That monitor worked great, but it was time to move to something with a more modern USB hub to simplify and declutter my desk.

The main monitor is the Studio Display. I need accurate colors for photo editing, and Lightroom works best with 2 monitors. The was one trick need for setup. Initially, I plugged the USB-C connector for the Dell into one of the 4 Thunderbolt ports on the Studio Monitor. The Dell didn't detect a signal and the Mac didn't detect the Dell. I plugged the Dell in using an HDMI cable, and it worked fine. So then I plugged the Dell's USB-C directly into a Thunderbolt port on the back of the Mac Studio. Then in worked fine. So the Dell might have problems if there is another device between the computer and the Dell in a Thunderbolt daisy chain.

Compared with the Mac Studio Display, which is a 5K Retina display, the Dell has accurate colors, but as would be expected, they just don't have the brilliance and pop of the Studio Display, which costs 5 times as much. However, getting accurate colors after calibration with my Color Monkey is better than what I had with my previous display (Philips) which looked nice, but the colors couldn't be made to match up.

So I'm giving 4 stars for now (will revise if the Dell develops problems in the next few months) but for the price, I don't think you could get a better display. I like the number of input ports, and it also has some USB-3 ports which those using it with a laptop will find useful.",29,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722QC

I resolved that issue by selecting a resolution lower than the native display resolution, and by using a System Settings > Accessibility setting that allows me to easily magnify the screen by pressing the Control key and swiping up with two fingers on the track pad. This works well for me and I find it very easy to make the small text easily readable for me.

It is also very easy to change to alternate resolutions through System Settings > Displays.

I connect between the display and my MBP with the supplied USB-C cable which facilitates the video connection and provides charging to my MBP. I now have only two cables to connect and disconnect to my MBP – the display cable and an external (portable) hard drive that functions as my Time Machine Backup.

I tried the internal speakers on the Dell display but they were not nearly as good as the internal speakers on my MBP. I also could not easily control audio volume from my MBP, so for me, the speakers are of no value.

As soon as I unplug the USB-C cable, the noise stops. The noise periodically changes, too, which is very distracting and annoying.

The build quality is overall pretty good, and the picture quality is good except when viewing light colors against a colorful background- for example, dark red background with white text. The text looks terrible in these scenarios.

All things considered, I like these monitors, but the sound is driving me crazy and I may have to return them for that reason. Unfortunately, since I purchased two of them and they both do it, I wouldn't purchase this monitor again.

** Update **

An update after owning these for two months:

Again, I would never purchase these monitors again. The noise is a constant disturbance. But aside from that, another thing that I've never experienced with any other external monitor on a Macbook is that the windows become rearranged after waking up from sleep.

What I mean by this is that I have two of these monitors, and each monitor has 3 ""desktops"". I have different apps all rearranged on each desktop according to my preference. Once the Macbook goes to sleep and I wake it from sleep- even if I don't physically turn the monitors off- all of the application windows become rearranged to different desktops.

Its is extremely annoying and cuts down tremendously on my productivity as nearly each time I wake the Macbook from sleep, I have to rearrange all my windows to where I wanted them.

So far, I am happy with this purchase. It's just big enough. I was looking at a 32"", but I'm glad I chose this 27""; a 32"" would have taken over my desk.

The speakers are fine, I don't hear any noise, and the screen has not faded to black. Maybe I've been lucky, but things just seem to work out for me.",0,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722QC

Unfortunately the USB-C provided charging leads to over-charging my MacBook Pro.

When plugged into USB-C the laptop gets unusually hot. Even when the laptop is turned off and already charged to 100%, it gets very hot. I unplug it from the monitor and it goes back to room temperature.

There is a setting on this monitor to disable USB-C charging when the monitor itself is powered off, but that does not help me for 8 hours a day when both are in operation.

The only solution I have found is to FIRST plug into an authentic Apple wall charger, then secondly plug into monitor. This means that I never make use of the monitor-provided power, and the concept of a single-cable docking won’t work.

Some items to note though if using on an M1 Mac with Monterey 12.1. For some frustrating reason, Apple has decided to enable VRR for external displays that support the feature by default. This means every time you wake your laptop/monitor from sleep, the monitor will default to VRR 40-60hz which is NOT desirable. Some have reported flickering, I have not experienced this, but regardless, you want full 60hz at all times. There is currently no way to permanently disable this protocol at the time of writing this review. You will have to manually adjust the refresh rate to a flat 60hz every time. There is no way to disable VRR on the monitor directly in the OSD menu. Very frustrating, and am hoping either Dell adds this option or Apple fixes this.

Second, you MUST switch USB-Prioritization to ""High Resolution"" in order to get full 4K 60hz RGB 30-bit. By default, it's set to ""High Data Rate"" which caps the output to 4K 60hz ycbcr (24-bit I believe?) which is inferior. Took me a bit to discover this as it's not explicitly stated anywhere. This does cap the monitors USB port to 2.0 speeds I believe, so there is a tradeoff involved.

UPDATE: As of Monterey 12.2, the vrr issue has been resolved and the monitor defaults to 60hz. As a side note, install the app lunar on your Mac to gain access to keyboard controls for brightness and monitor speaker audio - works flawlessly.

I needed a second monitor for use with my Mac Studio and overall multimedia setup, which includes a 5.1 AV receiver with multiple HDMI sources including Apple TV, cable TV box, blue ray, etc.

I connect my Mac via USB-C to this monitor’s USB-C connection and connect my 5.1 AV receiver to the monitor’s HDMI 1 port that supports HDCP 2.3 (and earlier) which is needed to support 4K copyrighted content.

This monitor also has an audio output jack that can be used to connect to the AV receiver’s audio input which is needed since computer monitors don’t typically support HDMI ARC. I am thus able to use the HDMI and audio capabilities of this monitor and my 5.1 AV receiver as a small format home theater setup - right on my desk. I’m okay with everything being 60 Hz since that’s all the Mac supports.

When I need 2 screens for computer use, but still want to listen to 5.1 audio, watch TV, stream content, I put the HDMI input from the AV receiver into the Picture in Picture (PIP) window while the rest of the screen is dedicated to USB-C display from my Mac.

I could have also sent the Mac video through the AV receiver via HDMI to the Dell monitor, but I didn’t want to have to turn on the receiver just to use the Dell as a second monitor. My main monitor’s audio is sufficient for office tasks.

So you are playing a game of chance it would seem. My odds were bad because 2/3 of the monitors I received had the noise issue.

Ran a Windows 10 and newer Windows 11 computer through an inexpensive switchbox seemless with no issues whatsoever. Only had to switch one button to go between computers and everything functioned perfectly.
The only good thing I can say is that imagery on this model was as advertised-beautiful picture with excellent resolution. Sadly, after 2-3 hours of trying everything, the best I could do was to get only one computer to work through this model with a conventional hook-up. Disappointingly, I could not get it to work through the switchbox, one USB port was useless: I couldn't get my keyboard or bluetooth usb mouse to work in it. Beyond this, the mickey-mouse buttons located at the bottom of the display were ridiculously tedious to work with-just the idea of having to use those in a 3 step process to simply switch from one computer to another was a deal-breaker itself. I didn't spend $300 for something that was less easy to work with than a $20 switchbox-forget the fact that I couldn't even get a keyboard to work through it-I had to run it through my computer. One more thing-guess some may peg me a just a cranky old guy, but the hook-ups for everything could have been much easier and convenient to work with if they were simply on the back of the monitor.

Dead.
Dell support told me ""this model is end of life"".
You can't even pay them to repair it.
A $400 monitor isn't expected to last 2 years apparently. It also had weird video glitches using Chrome (they went away when I switched to Firefox).

Now that I know what I do, I won't be buying another 4k monitor for a while. Most streaming services don't stream 4k to personal computers (see their supported device lists). It requires 4 times to resources as full HD and doesn't look that much better honestly. You need a fast internet service and strong wifi signal, since most streaming services will automatically select the quality based on your download speed / consistency. You usually can't pause and let it buffer then come back later (youtube seems to be an exception).

I bought a PS5 a few months before this thing died, and watched some 4k movies and played some games in 4k. Yea the movies looked good, but not that much better than full HD. I hardly noticed much of a difference in visual quality in the PS5 games in fidelity mode (reportedly most games aren't even native 4k but get upscaled), yet the performance improvement is noticeable in performance mode and not something you want to give up after playing with it. I replaced this monitor with an ASUS full HD gaming monitor that does 120hz+ and has 1ms response time, and WOW playing Uncharted 4 (has a 120hz mode) is awesome.

So yea... there's not much of a reason to buy a 4k monitor unless you have a really powerful video card and play games.

After using the first S2722QC for a round a month, I start to get used to it and even feel this is a pretty good monitor, regarding the price.

With a monitor that arrived in un-usable condition (a constant high-pitched noise when the screen is not active), I thought the replacement monitor would also be new. But it is a refurbished one with a label from Dell outlet stores. (There are many scratches on the bottom but the outward-showing parts all look new enough for me. It's the re-furbished innards that I worry about). I know it's better for the environment to refurbish, but I stopped buying refurbished products years ago because I had gotten too many duds. (Also, chances are that Dell is selling these for cheaper at its outlet store than the new Amazon price I paid.)

If this replacement monitor holds up and has a good lifespan, then maybe I will end up happy with it and with Dell. (The picture quality is excellent, and the set-up with Apple laptops is super-easy.) For now, what I can unambiguously praise Dell for is that the customer service on the phone was excellent and fast (after Amazon connected me to Dell). But if any of you also receive a defective product out of the box, I would see if you can get *Amazon* to send you a new one, and ask if you can avoid going through the Dell process.

UPDATE: It seems I am getting excellent service on this defective item. After I was unable to get through to Dell customer service from the Dell website, I clicked on the Amazon button for service (in my order history). Amazon got me on the phone with a Dell rep. And Dell is responding in a very fast and convenient way. Instead of having to go weeks without a new monitor, they are apparently sending it immediately, probably the next business day. And I can schedule a pick up of the defective monitor from my home. So, both the Amazon and Dell people came to the rescue. (When I get the new monitor, I will try to revise this review yet again to increase the # of stars!)

Must be nice to get one of these that works! I just received the monitor yesterday. It makes a loud high-pitched noise every second that it is in sleep mode. It even keeps making this obnoxious noise for awhile after I've unplugged it. I would have let Dell try to help trouble-shoot before writing a negative review. But I think they deserve a negative review because their customer service is not available. (When I inputted the tag number for this device on their site, none of the three contact options--email, chat, phone--was available.) I think I needed to wait about 12 days to receive this delivery (not too slow for these times). Yet, now if I try to get a replacement closer to the holidays, I fear I won't be able to get one for long past the time I wanted to be working with it.",27,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722QC

The swivel is simple to use, the plug in out of the box, they charge the Macbook with USB-C and have 2 USB ports on the backside for peripheral charging and connectivity.
My only wish would be that the image could be smaller - which I am honestly not sure what is driven by. Is it the resolution (this is 4K!) or is it I/O or is it the macbook graphics card? Anyway, for <$900 I could get 2 27"" 4K monitors with USB-C charging.

I received my re-purchased device to find ANOTHER dead pixel. Returned and got a Gigabyte M27U, which has been incredible vs. this Dell. (I get over 60hz with the M27U.) I suppose if you are fine with 60hz and you get one with working pixels, you'll enjoy this for the price. But having gotten two defective monitors, I'm done with Dell.

Also, returning these is painful. They don't come in cardboard boxes, so Amazon makes me shell out $43 bucks at UPS to box it up. Travesty.

This monitor is simply wonderful. HDR is bright, everything is super sharp, and the menu buttons are in a great spot. I got this for my work laptop vs. two screens as my office area is limited, so having 4k meant I could better use my space. Nothing bad to say after setting it up. The next day I was out of the house (I WFH) and didn't get to really test it out until now.

Come to find an obnoxious dead pixel right in the middle of the screen. My other Dell monitor (for my gaming desktop) has no issues, so this was a big disappointment. Also noticed after running the Windows 11 HDR calibration tool that I was experiencing extreme ghosting with black text on white backgrounds. Amazon can't replace it, so I had to return and order again--another bad taste in my mouth with was to be my first foray into 4k monitors. fingers crossed the next one will be fine.",4,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722QC

The major problem - the backlight became flickering and image become like ""made from many vertical lines"" when i'm using warm gamma. It can be achieved either via monitor settings (Warm color mode) or via macbook settings (nightshift mode)

In ""normal gamma"" monitor works well, but ""normal gamma"" is bad for working at the evening

MacBook Air M1

SOLUTION to the problem:
I researched a bit, try some stuff and got a solution which worked for me. Hope It will help u.
It seems like bad image quality and flickering occurs when the monitor is using YcBcr input color format (You can check it in monitor settings - OSD)
The only way i can force the monitor to use RGB format was to set usb-prioritisation to ""high resolution"" instead of ""high data speed"" in a monitor settings.
After this i got RGB input format, it solved problems with bad image quality, flickering and so on. BUT i sacrificed the speed of built-in usb ports - now they are in usb 2.0 mode, so not good for an external SSD or a usb stick connected to the monitor, but at least i get rid of that flickering.

UPD: RGB mode doesn't completely fix the flickering. It makes it better but flickering still occurs on particular yellowish gamma

UPD: after 1 month of using it, it starts to blink everytime even without night shift. So its just wasting of money. Terrible monitor. I will never buy Dell. Thats just scam which costs me 300+ $. Unfortunately i'm located outside of US and probably will not be able to return this CRAP. Never buy this monitor

UPD. After about 3 month of using it i can state that most of the time monitor works quite well and doesnt flicker. Probably because i mostly use it during daytime, so in ""normal gamma"". But sometimes it start to flicker and i have to change brightnes/contrast/gamma to stabilise it.
Afterall i do not recommend this monitor. It was so unexpectable that dell can make this so bad. Well, seems like dell nowadays is a different from dell which i knew. As for me, my next monitor will be definately NOT dell",19,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722QC

One standout feature that immediately caught my attention is the camera design with privacy in mind. As someone concerned about online security, having the ability to put away the camera for full privacy when not in use is a game-changer. It ensures that there's no risk of unwanted hackers hijacking my camera, giving me complete peace of mind during my work or leisure time.

The camera quality itself is top-notch, delivering clear and crisp video for video conferencing or virtual meetings. When I need to use it, the camera pops up effortlessly, ready to capture moments in exceptional detail.

Another brilliant addition to this monitor is the conveniently placed USB slot on the bottom front. It's an absolute lifesaver when I need to charge or connect my devices quickly. I no longer have to fumble around the back of the monitor, searching for ports. This front USB slot allows for easy access, saving me valuable time and effort.

Additionally, the fact that the Dell S2722DZ monitor charges my laptop while it's connected is a fantastic bonus. It's one less thing to worry about, and I can seamlessly work on my laptop without fear of it running out of battery.

The monitor's overall performance and picture quality are nothing short of impressive. The colors are vibrant, and the sharpness of images is exceptional. The size is just right for multitasking, allowing me to have multiple windows open side by side without feeling cramped.

The adjustable stand is a fantastic feature, enabling me to find the perfect height and angle for optimal comfort during long work sessions. The slim bezels add a touch of modern elegance, making this monitor a stylish addition to any workspace.

Setting up the monitor was a breeze, and the user-friendly interface made navigation and customization a delight.

In conclusion, the Dell S2722DZ monitor has exceeded my expectations in every way. Its cutting-edge privacy feature, convenient front USB slot, and laptop charging capability have made it an invaluable asset in my daily work and entertainment routines. If you're seeking a monitor that seamlessly combines advanced technology with user-centric design, look no further. The Dell S2722DZ monitor is a true game-changer and gets my highest recommendation!",4,

The QHD (2560x1440) resolution works great for this monitor size, Windows 10/11 shows the recommended scale (under settings > display settings) is 100%. I also have a 27"" 4K UHD (3840x2160) LG monitor, and the recommended scale is 150%, which makes everything the same size as this monitor, but text is crisper when looking at it from 10 inches away, whereas text on this monitor is a bit pixelated. At a normal viewing distance, however, the text looks virtually identical between the two monitors. Compared to the LG monitor, this one swivels and extends up and down further, which I prefer. The LG (it's the 27UP850-W) doesn't swivel and doesn't extend as far down as this Dell, which may not be an issue for some/most users. On the other hand, this Dell monitor delivers 65W to your laptop over USB-C, while the LG delivers 95W (better for MacBook Pros), but it's also $220 more than this Dell (as of today's prices).

The included camera is convenient and works as expected. You can hide it (push it in) when not in use, which is a nice privacy feature. The quality is mediocre, though. If you compare it to your cell phone's webcam (which you can connect to your computer for free via Camo app on the phone and Camo Studio on Mac/PC), it's night and day. The included camera, which runs at 1080 resolution, pales in comparison to your smartphone's camera, which the free version of Camo runs at 720 resolution. It's like a toy camera from the 1970s compared to a modern top-of-the-line digital camera. Don't get me wrong, the camera is serviceable; it's just mediocre and low quality.

Overall, I recommend this monitor. It works great.",10,

I can manage for now. 3) I wish it had dedicated buttons to switch between inputs (different computers for me) rather than using the on-screen menu.

(1) Connect the MBP to the Monitor using the included USBC to USBC cable
(2) Pop-up the camera (obviously)
(3) Go into Photobooth. In Photobooth, under ""camera"" you will now see you ""Facetime"" camera and the ""dell"" camera. Check-on the Dell Camera.
(4) Go into system preferences to and choose the audio output to be the Monitor. Probably could do the microphone, but haven't tried it.

Dell support is terrible. In 90min they transferred me to one person after the other. Never again.
Apple support is simply awesome.

I downloaded Dell Display Manager, but it is useless and I think only works for windows.
I have no idea if there is firmware/drivers for this for the Mac.

60 day update; Changed to 1 star. Do not recommend for MAC users.
- The MAC keeps ""forgetting"" about the camera. Sometimes multiple times a day. Requires you to go back into facetime to discover it again.
- Run into a new problem where randomly the sound volume will go from 100% to 0%. Pretty frustrating when you are on a call and realize you cant hear everyone. So then you either have to change the speakers to the MBP... or reach over and toggle with the buttons below the monitor to increase volume.

No doubt this is mostly APPLE problems, but doesn't matter if it is not compatible.",37,

-Integrated Speakers

Cons-
-The speakers are not very loud at full volume. They sound tinny in meeting and sometimes will not work at all.
-The colors are not very accurate. The grays look beige with makes any design work impossible. Don’t get this monitor if you need accurate colors.
-The worst thing for me is the brightness. On maximum 100% brightness this thing is a joke! Even in a dark room it’s hard to see. Next to my laptop screen is looks maybe half the overall brightness.
-Only one USB-C port. It would be nice to have a few more ports for mouse keyboard etc
-No daisy chaining. You have to connect multiple monitors to a dock .

Overall I think some people will be okay with this monitor for the price. I’m going to keep looking as the brightness and speaker quality are not quite good enough for my needs.",0,

This monitor caught my eye because the USB-C port also has the ability to charge my laptop, cutting a cable out of the mix. Even better, it has a built-in webcam, removing yet another cable from my workspace.

This monitor is great. It looks like a high-quality device even before it's turned on, with a super-slim bezel and a smooth back with clearly marked ports. Once it's on, the picture quality is solid, as good or better than my HDMI monitors of the same size. Colors are bright, the picture is crisp, and the height and angle adjustments are versatile (or if you prefer, you can attach it to a 100mm x 100mm VESA mount). Hooking it up was as simple as plugging it in and connecting the included surprisingly long and sturdy-feeling USB-C cable to my laptop. I didn't mess with the settings much, just enough to flip through all of the included modes and decide that standard mode looked the best. Each of the others looked off-kilter in some way.

Since this monitor is clearly intended for video conferencing, I decided to use it for my Zoom HOA meeting that night. The webcam popped up easily and was automatically detected. The 5MP camera gave a really nice, clear picture, both during the test / join window and when I was scrunched up in the corner after everyone joined. It actually took me half the meeting to realize that I should be surprised how good the picture was in the low light of my living room! The sound was pretty good, but not as good as my laptop speakers (which are actually really nice, so that's not a big complaint). The mic captured everything my wife and I said during the meeting, and nobody seemed to have any trouble hearing us.

Is this a gaming monitor? No, and it's not intended to be. This is a business monitor that helps you keep a tidy desk. It'll work for some light gaming, but don't expect it to support your next-gen AAA titles at max graphics settings. For what it's intended to do though, this is a top-tier monitor that's worth every cent just for not making me manage 2 more cables.",7,

Coming from a smaller monitor to this huge 27 inches is so nice.
The monitor itself is very nice, well built and even though the viewable screen size is much bigger, it is not that much bigger compared to my older monitor which had a very big bezel.

Setting it up was a breeze as all I had to do was plug it into an outlet and then connect it to the dock via USB-C.

The picture was stunning, and even though it is not a 4K monitor, movies looked amazing on the screen. I specifically chose this monitor because of the built in webcam which make it so convenient when I have my zoom meetings. Previously I had a standalone webcam that I needed to sit on top of the screen and then remove and unplug when I was done as it was not very stable. I really like how with a single press I can hide the camera or bring it out for meetings.

Another thing that I really like are the built in dual 5W speakers which sounded very nice. The dual noise cancelling microphone is also another nice addition as I no longer need to use my earbuds and people in zoom said that they could hear me loud and clear.

Last but not least, the USB ports make it very easy for me to charge my phone and surprisingly, the USB-C port has enough power to charge my ultra-book.

All in all, I really love my new 27 inches monitor which gets a perfect score from me.",2,

The resolution is not enough for the 4k video, however. I certainly won't recommend this monitor for gamers. I wouldn't say that I was very impressed with the camera: it is tiny despite taking huge space on top of the monitor. I feel like my iphone front camera is much better than that on this monitor.

I upgraded the memory to 32gb (16x2) and internal storage to 2tb and finished it off with a Windows 11 fresh install. Took a little time getting the drivers to see the hardware with the fresh install, but I got everything working after 15 minutes and a Google search.

With the added memory and storage this is a future-proof laptop for about $650 total cost laptop and upgrades

It was pretty much ready to go right out-of-the-box. Setup was easily done by following the prompts on the screen.

Overview:
The laptop has a powerful AMD Ryzen7 processer. It is lightweight, compact and attractive looking with a 14"" display screen and a slim design. It ships with 8GB of RAM (upgradable to 16GB), and 512GB of SSD storage. There are three USB ports (2 type A and 1 type C). There is also a media card reader, audio jack, and HDMI port. (There is no ethernet port.) There are built-in dual microphones, background noise reduction, and enhanced audio speakers. The build-in camera has a privacy shutter. The keyboard is backlit.

The laptop needed a few updates to the OS, Windows 11 Pro, before it was ready to use. Once the updates were complete, it wanted me to sign in to a microsoft account to begin setup. While I have a microsoft account, I prefer not to use it every time I sign on. Since this is not a review of Windows 11, I'll just say that there are workarounds for that, just do a google search, and you will find tutorials on how to set up a local account, bypassing the need to use your microsoft account.

I have been using this laptop for the past week and it has been living up to my expectations. It is a fully-featured machine that does pretty much everything I need. I am not using it for gaming, so I can't test that out, but it does fine on the internet to access websites, pay bills, write documents (ie google office), play videos; everyday stuff. My husband is using it to do work for his job from home. It's fast and responsive and we both like it.

Screen:
The screen is bright and the colors are good. I didn't need to make any adjustments. In comparison to my older 14-inch Dell, the 16:10 screen has a bit more area. The bezels are thinner, making full use of the available screen area. The maximum screen resolution is 1920 x 1200, which is more than sufficient for using applications, the internet and watching video. The one thing missing is a touchscreen.

Keyboard:
The keyboard is comfortable and easy to type on. The backlit keyboard is a huge plus for me. When I use the laptop in the evening, it makes it so much easier to see in a low light environment.

The unit has a large touchpad. I find it difficult to navigate and frustrating to use for any length of time. Maybe it's just me. I’m not a touchpad person. If I need to be productive, I use a mouse. If I don't have a mouse, I like to have a touchscreen, which this laptop does not have.

Sound:
The audio from the built-in speakers is good, much better clarity than I was expecting. The laptop has built in dual microphones and built in noise reduction (I have not tested that yet. I will update when I do.)

Performance:
Boot-up is fast. The laptop runs quiet, with no noise from the fan. Heat does not appear to be a problem. However, I do use a stand when the laptop is on the table, so I have good airflow. The wifi connection is solid. (One of my older Dell laptops would randomly disconnect, which was extremely annoying, but that seems to have been corrected.)

Conclusion:
There is a lot to like about this laptop. It's perfect for those seeking a richly featured laptop in an affordable price range. With the addition of more RAM, this could be a desktop replacement for me.",18,

The display is above average with FHD plus resolution, decent graphics, mediocre RAM size (upgradable) but at least DDR4 and average size SSD

You get all the usual connections like USB 3 and USB-C plus display port SD card and for some reason only HDMI 1.4 and you will probably need to use the displayport to output 4K to another monitor/tv. No ethernet port but I don't have one on my more expensive work laptop

Keyboard is comfortable enough for a laptop (i'm not a fan of laptop keyboards in general...) and its backlit. The touchpad works fine. Be ready to wait it out on startup for some updates to come in

This is a premium thin-and-light from Dell, and I just have to say that the Inspiron line is a lot sleeker and nicer looking than it was a few years ago. I think that you get most everything you would expect at this price point, except for a couple of things that I would have liked to have seen (like USB 4, 16GB of Ram, and a brighter screen with full HDR/Dolby Vision support)

As for the specs of this machine, you get a 15 watt/U-Series Ryzen 7 paired with 8GB of Ram. But don't worry because you can easily add a second stick of 3200MHz CL22 DDR4 for laptops, the bios doesn't mess up the XMP profile like some brands. Dell is using Kingston brand for the pre-installed stick, but I used a Sabrent brand module for the second one that I added because it was all I had on hand. The SSD is from SK Hynix and it's decently fast for PCIe gen 3, I got speeds of 1900MB/s for sequential read and 1750MB/s for sequential write speed. It is a tiny, little 2230 sized M.2 from SK Hynix. This supports Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2, it is using a Mediatek, M.2 wireless card. I thought that it might be disappointing like a lot of the Realtek wireless cards are, but it actually seems to be almost as good as Intel cards.

There is a 54 watt hour battery inside of this laptop, and it lasts between 7-8 hours on balanced mode. That isn't bad but it's also not what I would expect from a mobile, Ryzen 5000 series processor. I previously reviewed the Surface Laptop 4 and that laptop can last for 16 hours with just a slightly larger battery (but also a larger screen). But, you do get the power with this chip, the Ryzen 7 5825U is basically their top of the line processor for ultrabooks. It should be able to handle just about anything you need it to do, so long as it is a task that makes sense for this form factor. It doesn't have a discrete GPU, even if the Amazon listing was a little unclear about that fact. It does have a decently powerful integrated GPU, although it is still using Vega in the 8 graphical Compute Units that make up the GPU of this chip. You won't see the kind of performance that you would if this was a 6000 series chip (RDNA 2 graphics), but it is still capable of 720p/60fps at low-medium settings. But please temper your expectations a bit, if you truly care about gaming on a laptop, you can do better for this amount of money. This is a thin and light and it is not designed to be a gaming-first type of device.

The keyboard is good, it has a backlight and a fingerprint scanner integrated into the home button that works with Windows Hello, this makes for a very convenient experience with unlocking your laptop. The typing experience is enjoyable with a decent amount of key-travel for a chiclet style keyboard. The trackpad is also good, it does use precision touch drivers, so it feels very responsive and accurate.

There are more than enough ports for this kind of laptop, you get a full-blown USB C port that supports gen 2 data transfer speeds, Power Delivery charging, and video output. There is also an HDMI port, a headphone jack, an SD Card reader (UHS-I), 2x USB A ports, and a proprietary barrel plug for charging the laptop with the included wall charger. You can charge this with USB C, but I kept getting an annoying message saying that the charger I was using was not sufficient for optimal use, which is weird since it was a 100w Power Delivery 3.0 wall charger that supports all the latest features (including PPS). The charger that came in the box is 65 watts and does NOT charge using USB C.

The display is a 14"" 1920x1200/60Hz IPS panel, and it looks good, but not great. I think that the colors could be a little more vibrant and I wish it was brighter. I like that the bezels are thin, it keeps the whole entire laptop looking really modern and attractive. The webcam has a slider, so you can cover it to block the camera lens, for privacy/security. I also want to point out that this computer is setup properly with all of the best features enabled for security. It had core isolation and secure boot turned on, by default and the BIOS is configured in a most secure way also.

Pros+

Lightweight, beautiful laptop

Good keyboard/trackpad with backlight and fingerprint scanner

Decent battery life (although it could be a bit better)

Privacy shutter for the webcam

Good performance thanks to the Ryzen 7 5825U

Ram can be easily upgraded, and the BIOS doesn't stop you from enabling XMP profiles (so that you can get the full speed of the Ram that you are using)

Dell is using name brand internal components (SK Hynix SSD, Kingston DDR4, MediaTek wireless card)

Cons-

No USB 4

Only 8GB of RAM (IMO, it should come with 16GB), can be easily remedied

Display could be brighter and have better support for HDR video (HDR10/HLG/Dolby Vision)

Update: I just assumed that the panel they were using on this laptop was 100%sRGB, but in fact, it is actually 45%NTSC. This is kind of crazy to me, considering the maximum brightness is only 250 nits. If you spent the same amount of money on a MacBook Air, you would get a much brighter and more vibrant screen. (DCI-P3 and 400 nits of brightness, with HDR support). I still think that this is a good laptop overall, but I really feel like it should cost about $700 tops, a bad screen can really ruin the day.",25,

For some reason all of my kids as toddlers have been obsessed with pulling keys off keyboards. Today my 3 year old was being suspiciously quiet and I found him hiding behind the couch pulling all the keys off my keyboard. If you’ve ever been through this you know it’s a huge pain because usually the little brackets underneath or the clips on the key that hold it to the bracket break if you pull them off and they never go on right or won’t even stay on. I’m happy to say that while all the keys shown in the photo were pulled off (and not carefully I might add) all of them went back on perfectly. The “G” key kind of sits a little funny because one corner underneath did break but it still stays on and is usable. Anyway I’m super impressed that they’d keys are holding up to a toddler determined to pull them all off!

I’ve been needing a new laptop for a while now. My toddlers got ahold of my Asus and broke and pulled off half the keys on the keyboard and my trackpad buttons kept getting stuck. This is the exact same size as my ASUS but it does have less features for about double the cost. One of the things I loved about my ASUS that cost about 500 a couple years ago is that it was touch screen and the screen would open all the way up to the backside of the keyboard and function as a tablet. This doesn’t have either of those features but probably is a bit better guts wise. This one is surprisingly only a little bit heavier and thicker than my Asus. One thing that I appreciate on this laptop is that the trackpad is bigger and much more responsive. I haven’t lost the cursor yet and had to tap and swipe around the trackpad for a couple seconds to find it like happened with my ASUS. The fingerprint login is kind of cool but unfortunately within the first couple times of using it, it already wasn’t recognizing me and I had to just enter the passcode anyway. I also feel like this laptop pretty fast and responsive in general. I don’t do anything crazy but it has run my websites and my Cricut design space well that I use the most well. It also brought everything over from my Google account which was nice. I wish it would bring over all my downloaded fonts but I’m sure that will be easy enough with a flash drive. Speaking of drives, this has a usb-c port which is nice for all the newer devices. It also has an SD slot but you will need an adaptor for a micro SD card which is a bummer since almost everything is micro now. There is no disc drive of any type on this laptop which I know is pretty obsolete these days anyway but thought I would mention it. Another thing I appreciated about this laptop is that the plug for the wall is normal sized so it doesn’t take up multiple outlet spaces. That of course means it has that big box about halfway through the cord but I don’t mind that so much. The battery lasted about a day and a half of casual use which is acceptable. The keyboard is backlit which is nice. It also give that full clicking feeling so you know you hit the button but is still very quiet. Lastly when the top opens it kind of tips the keyboard up a bit if sitting on a flat surface. This will be nice for ergonomics as well as allowing the bottom to stay cool.
A couple things I didn’t love about this laptop include that the display seems a little off to me and there are some not great cosmetic choices. When I opened my Cricut design space I immediately noticed a difference between this laptop and my old one. The colors just seem dull or off in some way but just a bit. I tried adjusting it in the settings but couldn’t find anything that would let me adjust it to where I liked. I also noticed in the settings that it has a setting for an on screen touch keyboard which really confused me since it’s not a touch screen. Also the apostrophe and quotations key on the keyboard looks backwards to me. I know it could technically be right but I’ve never seen a keyboard with it facing this direction. Also the top of my laptop has identical irregular dents in the corners. I noticed them almost right away so I don’t think I caused them. Also the fact that they’re pretty symmetrical makes me think it’s part of the design somehow but it looks awful. Lastly as far as negatives, it made a weird buzzing sound the whole time I was setting it up that had me a bit concerned but once I had all the setup done it went away. I have no idea what caused that.
Overall this is a nice laptop and will definitely work for my more casual uses. I do think it’s overpriced but maybe I’m just out of the loop since buying my last laptop a few years ago. I think if I were shopping to buy a laptop I would definitely look for a better priced option with similar features and specs before trying this.",6,

This laptop turns on real fast. It only take seconds until main screen if fully on and everything is loaded.
This is important to me because my old laptop takes a long time to be fully loaded.
When I use this laptop on gaming, It is crystal clear and not laggy. It handles very well and fast.
Meanwhile I can still have few other programs on at the same time. They were all nice and smooth too.
This Dell laptop also provides data migrated system to transfer the data from old laptop.
But it has to be done within 6 months. It is still really good.
I can convert everything over to this laptop from my old one.
The FHD screen itself is very clear but it does feel somehow darker screen even on the brightness setting.
I love this size a lot. Small and lightweight that I can put it into my diaper bag. Bring it with me everywhere I go. I love everything in this laptop but RAM. I definitely have to upgrade it to at least 16GB RAM.

I’m also just a general user and not 100% computer tech savvy, so this review is from someone who is just going to go over the physical attributes and some other things. It’s going to sound like I’m complaining about small things - but for me it’s the small things I notice. It’s also going to sound like I’m complaining a lot but I promise overall this is a great laptop.

My very first laptop I ever owned was a Dell notebook that I used and abused, my 2nd laptop was another Dell - an Inspiron M531R that I wasn’t a fan of and had issues with, then I switched to another brand I hated the computer from the day I got it. Now, I have decided to switch back to Dell and try the Inspiron again with the newest Windows software, AMD Ryzen 7, and newest hardware.

The specs are fine for a general user and should be able to do anything you need to do other than hardcore gaming. One thing I do wish it had was 16gb of ram instead of 8gb since I’m going backwards compared to what my computer I purchased in 2018 had. I’m also going from 1TB of memory to 512gb, which isn’t the end of the world because I wasn’t even close to using the 512gb.

I got the “pebble green” but I wish the color was more green. I could barely tell it was any sort of green shade when comparing it to my silver laptop of another brand.

The box has the laptop, charger, and instructions. Out of the box it was not charged and needed to be plugged in. The first thing I did after setting it up was seeing how much memory was already used by the pre-programmed stuff. Sometimes laptops come filled with a bunch of junk programs that you’ll never use. This laptop had 45gb already used by programs, data, and other miscellaneous things which isn’t awful.

The next thing I went over was the actual physical aspects of the laptop. I’m going from a 15.6” laptop to 14 so it’s taking quite a bit to get used to downsizing in size so much. 2 inches doesn’t seem like a lot until you put them side by side. Also because of the size it doesn’t include a number pad which is something I wish I would’ve realized earlier - but also not the complete end of the world since I can get a wireless one or one that plugs into the USB plug.

When placing my hands on the keys, the keys just seem a little far from the end of the laptop. What I mean by that is that a lot of my wrist and arm is laying on the laptop more so than my previous one and I think it’s because the touch pad is so large. I will miss not having buttons on the touchpad and it’s going to take me some getting used to clicking and scrolling with the newer touchpad. Right clicks are a little harder and the touch pad is a lot more sensitive. There is also a little ridge right before you get to the keypad which I think was un-needed.

The laptop opens maybe 140 degrees? It’s not a 180 degrees lay flat kind of laptop. There is also this rubber piece on the hinge that makes it so the laptop is always elevated in the back slightly. I’m not sure if I like it but I do see the pro of it never laying flat so the fan can circulate air. I think I would just personally like if it would lay flat for some reason.

As far as ports, I’m happy with what the laptop has. The charger port, one USB A on each side, an HDMI, usb C, and an SD card slot. Im happy to see the laptop still come with an SD card port because I use SD cards to transfer 3D printer files a lot.

One of the most important things to me for a laptop was battery because that was my biggest complaint with my old laptop - which literally didn’t hold a charge for 2 hours before it needed to be plugged in. I’ve tested this Inspiron multiple times now without a charger and it seems on average to last 7-8 hours. That isn’t fantastic but it’s significantly longer than my last one so I’m personally happy with that.

The display on this laptop is sharp and clear, I always have liked the matte screen versus a touch screen or covered screen. The volume is mediocre but I dont do a lot of things with audio anyways other than an occasional zoom call or YouTube video.

The webcam is also a lot better in this new Dell and would make it a good laptop for work where you have to zoom or Skype. There is also a little privacy cover for the camera which was kind of funny to me.

Now onto the software. You get windows 11 pro which is fast and convenient. I’ve always been a windows user so I know the ins and outs and have no complaints. I don’t like the windows pre programmed browsers so the very first thing I did was install Google Chrome instead.

To test out Windows 11 and the laptops hardware, I downloaded some programs I typically use including my 3D printer software which will probably be the most “powerful” program I run on there. It booted up fast and saved my information over to my SD card quick as well. This laptop combined with our high speed internet is fantastic for general browsing and running basic programs.

I know it sounds like I complained about a lot of things - but they are mostly just small annoyances that I will get used to over time. Overall this is a nice, sleek laptop that’s easy to travel with and holds a decent charge when unplugged. Windows 11 pro combined with the Ryzen 7 is also a great combo that allows you to do almost anything you’ll need to do.",6,

A few years ago they were very low-end machines with terrible specs and questionable quality. I wouldn't have even considered buying an Inspiron back then. But over the past year they have dramatically improved the quality and features of this line of laptops. Now Inspiron machines feature the latest CPUs and specs, and the build quality is almost as good as their XPS line. This new Inspiron 14 5425 model has one of the latest Ryzen CPUs, the 5825U. The Geekbench score is just under the Apple M1 CPU, so this is a fast machine. It also has 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD drive. My only complaint is that I think it should come with 16GB of RAM. But the speed seems fine with the current 8GB while running Windows 11. It weighs only 3.4 pounds, so it's very lightweight and easy to take anywhere with you.

The Celerons tend to run slow and although I don't do a whole lot on the laptops as a prefer to use a desktop, I don't have the patience for it to be too slow or for programs to get stuck because it doesn't have sufficient RAM.

It is small and lightweight.
The buttons are awesome, and scroll wheel is good.
Best part is that the dpi is high and so the mouse feels very responsive.
I got it on 17/01/2021 and on 19/01/2021, the mouse got a software update and now in the dell app you can change dpi settings of the mouse between 1000/1600/2400/4000 dpi.
Also i can't really tell the difference between the responsiveness of this mouse and g305.
The g305 has 1ms rated response time and these non-gaming mice are generally rated between 3-5 ms response rate so your eyes can hardly tell the difference.",2,顏色: 泰坦灰色

It does not. So it's misleading in that regard.

It is also NOT a touch screen. Despite being listed as such. Not sure if it's a setting or not, but I have not been able to get it to work. GET IT FIXED/UPDATED!

That said. I still enjoy the laptop and functions as any laptop of this caliber should. Gets bogged down just a little when running 3 monitors for my work station, but it is very minor. It does a fantastic job running more than a few programs like Word, Excel, Chrome, etc. at the same time. It's super light, the keyboard feels crisp, and the track pad is big where I don't feel like I run out of real estate moving the pointer.

2 stars for the false advertising.",0,

Compact.
Enough performance for everyday works and some more (development, virtualization) if it is with SSD drive. Otherwise (in my case laptop came with HDD which is not in description) it will work very slow.
Ergonomic full keyboard. Screen has good vewing angle and quality.
Cons
No RJ45 and Type-C ports (In description they was).
Cooling system is noicy when CPU load is more than 50%
Quality of keyboard and touch-pad is not a top.
Overall the plastic is very cheep and keeping fingerprints. You need to clean it often.
Warnings
Be careful when opening screen when laptop placed on desk as the bottom-back edge of screen cover can be scrubbed.
Overall
Not bad choice by performance/price.

P.S.
I have added M.2 NVMe 256 GB drive and replaced HDD with SATA 3 SSD 512GB drive. Works perfectly! Many thanks seller.",1,

This is an excellent budget PC for daily use -- thin & light design; super fast; brilliant & crisp display; always cool while working; and enough ports including legacy ports. And, in terms of design & performance, it compares very closely, and favorably with another great PC that I also use, the highly user-rated HP 15, model 15-dy1043dx (i5-1035G1, 12GB RAM, 256GB SSD); whose current version seems to be: HP 15-dy2021nr, also highly regarded!

Having used my Dell PC for several months now, I am super happy with it for daily work (mainly Web-based stuff, Zoom meetings, phone links via the MS Your Phone App, and plenty of MS Office Apps, mainly Word & Excel.) So, overall: 5 stars, STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

In terms of design and performance, this Dell PC also gets high user and expert ratings. (For info: this same PC is rated at an average of 4.7 stars by many customers of Best Buy. It is also rated by Windows Central Reviewers as the Best Budget Dell 15” PC of 2021!)

I made several phone calls to Dell technical support and they were directing me to Dell sales team and refuse to go to sales team as I am technically competent enough to make simple upgrade like this.
I kept on asking what kind of drive it takes in the secondary drive slot (2.5 inch with SSD cable attached MB) Dell has provided.
I was told that may be because of compatibility issues of SSD I am using, so I asked give me the compatibility list or the drive type it takes (the drive types are made with industry standards). Again I was told that our technical team is not trained to answer this question.
So all in all Dell wanted to sell me paid technical support for the information they are supposed to provide and sell hardware and installation service.

The problems started within a year of purchase. It still continues. Dell fixes the problems you shouldn't have in the first place. They don't care if you don't have the extended warranty. A person who pays more than $1000 shouldn't worry about the problems of the laptop. Dell simply rips you off by selling you messed up computers and making you pay for the fixes. What a problematic company! I will never buy from this brand again.,0,

It is a good value laptop, its functionality not to be confused with a gaming laptop or a high performance general laptop.
The biggest annoyance - it came preinstalled with windows 11. No choice, just installed itself after turning on. Windows 11 takes away many of the look-and-feel customizations, and the default design as well as many of the preset themes are ... childish? I don't know how to describe the bland default colors, it seems like the designers think a white piece of paper without edges, and barely visible dividing lines - when present, are some sort of eclectic design cue that they must follow. No offense, but the border-less look is not practical at all, and not pleasing to the user.
The second biggest annoyance, there is no contrast adjustments, hardware or software. And if you search for a solution, it seems like the entire web is plastered with tips on how to adjust brightness, and the only ""adjustment"" to contrast are recommendations on using one of the preset high-contrast themes. And boy... they are ugly.
But I kept mine and didn't return it.
After a couple of days I couldn't take the ugly windows 11 anymore so I bit the bullet and installed Linux Mint, the third version which is supposedly the lightest. Amazing how a free operating system would have three versions to help users get the most out of the system.
Anyways, great experience, minimal research before or after install, and the battery life was not adversely affect... That I can see. I use it to browse the web 3 to 4 hours at a time, and I use less than 1/2 the battery. I don't recharge it because then I use it again in morning for sounds an hour. Still left with lots of power.",0,

Can now only use it in 'desktop mode' with an external keyboard and mouse, but I'm not expecting it to remain operational much longer. And it's a little light to be repurposed as a boat anchor.

Your hand WILL touch the touchpad and then after realizing your typing disappeared your palm accidently selected part of your word document, your typing transpositioned to a random location or deleted.

Boring computer, no innovation, and one of the worst work laptops to use if you have to write tons of reports. Take my word for it:)",0,

The most striking feature is how far back the keys are from the front of the computer. It is uncomfortable. I have to actually rest my arm on the front of the laptop to reach the keys. I've had a lot of laptops and that is really odd. I also like my keys to be more raised --they are very flat- but that pales in comparison to how annoying the long reach to the keys is. If the normal reach is 4ish inches this would be an extra 2ish inches from the front of the computer to reach the keys. I was surprised that it thinks it is anti-glare. A striking feature was that it hurt my eyes right away. I immediately bought an anti-blue light protector on the second day. Other than that it seems decent. Booted right up.

He visto algunos comentarios que han pasado por algo similar, la forma más fácil de resolverlo es hablar con el soporte técnico de EUA si es que pueden comunicarse en inglés, la buena noticia es que a pesar de necesitar un cambio completo de la tarjeta madre la garantía y soporte de cambio es válida en México, espero el equipo no sea recolectado o reacondicionado por qué de ser así tendría que pagar gastos extras por modificaciones o uso que no le di yo, lástima por qué parece que no soy la única que se ha topado con fallos técnicos con este equipo y es extraño que el control de calidad sea tan bajo con un mismo revendedor siendo que la marca Dell es muy buena en relación calidad-precio.",2,

También funciona muy fluido con videojuegos, pero no puedo opinar mucho al respecto ya que no es el principal uso que le doy.

* Sturdy. Feels sturdy. Doesnt look like one of those LG/lenovo sleek models which might break anytime
* This is the new model/replacement to P2419H model, so if u are reluctant wether to purchase this compared to P2419H, you can blindly go for this. As this is just the same monitor but more recent model. They both are the same, this product has less reviews coz this monitor is released on 2021 and P2419H is 2018 released hence higher number of reviews.
* ZERO backlight bleeding. DELL has done a pretty good job at this
* Height is adjustable. Screen is 90 degree rotatable

I did a lot of research on the best fit for my situation. I wanted something that appeared somewhat professional and sleek, and most of the options in the price range are tailored for gamers and look like gaming monitors. I first looked at 4k monitors so that the resolution would be that far off but there just aren’t many ultra-high res options for less than $1,300. I forget exactly how I found this display, but I am glad I did. At the time of purchase, it was $679. I noticed as of a few days later the price went up above $700. I am sorry to see that for anyone interested in it. I was a little nervous about the resolution but had to remember I was still stepping up from a $150 1080p 24” monitor. I plan to use this connection to a new MBP, I am still on the fence about waiting for the possible updates next year. For now, I am using a windows 7 machine that I built like 8 years ago. Anyway, back to the resolution, 1140p looks good compared to 1080p and the fact that the screen is enormous is a real game-changer for productivity. I use mine for school and work and man it’s amazing having the windows side by side. Where I work, I have 2 monitors set up, I just prefer this so much more though. It’s clean, using less power, fewer cables, and does the same thing. You can even get “super ultra-wide” but I think it’s a bit overkill, at least for me. I recommend reading all the specs and features because there are many. You might find more info on dell.com.

Connectivity & settings: I plugged it in using a DP (display port) and it calibrated itself. I dint not change any settings, the aspect ratio was perfect! Color calibration and all settings are perfect. I will not be adjusting any of it. That’s cool to me, I mean I spent hours adjusting my 70” 4K TV. I still mess with it after years of ownership. Don’t forget this display comes with HDMI and Thunderbolt inputs with a few USB ports. So you could have this running your laptop and keeping it charged to boot.

Image quality: It might be that my old monitor just sucked, but I am so happy with this purchase. The image quality and clarity are fantastic for what it claims to be. This monitor is not advertised as UHD so if you expect UHD, it’s not. But seriously, most people out the can relax about that. This is not comparable to say, an iMac retina display. So it would look out of place next to one, but as your primary display and laptop in clamshell mode, this is not going to disappoint. I downloaded a ton of high res ultra-wide images for my backgrounds. They look awesome. I ran a couple of color and gamma tests and this display was calibrated perfectly right out of the box. Plug and play, in my experience. Oh, it is worth noting that it is pretty bright, no complaints about brightness.
Build quality: I like the design of the display because it looks great at the home of the office. I am not a fan of gaming-style displays, they just look a little cheesy to me with added logos and lines. I think of this monitor as a conservative luxury design like a BMW 5 series vs. a Honda Civic Type R. Nothing against the Type R, it’s an outstanding automobile and an engineering marvel. It just looks like a cartoon. The bezel is about 1 CM and it has a ¾” chin at the bottom. It comes out of the box with a film on the screen. Most people won’t even notice it, and it is hardly noticeable except for the very edge and appears to be protecting the screen so I will be leaving it on unless it starts to peel naturally or something.

Included in the box: It came with several cables! I was thankful for that. I think it had a power cable, HDMI, DP and a USB-C, and some cable management accessories. The box was the least impressive part for me. It is very generic, just regular old cardboard, and the lady sat it down on its side in front of my door. Wind could have blown it over or something. Hey, she got it to me in working condition, so all good.

Bonus: I also ordered a new desk pad and Logi mouse. Both are awesome!

My one remaining quibble is the KVM only supports two devices, even though the monitor itself can connect three (HDMI + DisplayPort + USB-C) because there are only two upstream connections (USB-B & USB-C) for devices to access the monitor's ports. So if you want to share a keyboard and mouse amongst multiple devices, this monitor can handle two but not three. I rate it 4.5 stars with the latest firmware.
----
The P3421W is my first ultrawide and first curved screen, but I bought it specifically for its built-in KVM. The size is a reasonable replacement for dual screens, though it is still noticeably smaller than two 1080p's, as you might expect based on the resolution. The curve looked strange for about a day and after that I stopped noticing it. What drives me crazy is the KVM. I use it to switch between a Mac and a PC. I do not use the PIP/PBP features (it really isn't big enough for that). But it's always a gamble whether switching from one input to the other is going to find a signal, particularly if one machine has just woken from sleep. Switching back and forth between inputs can put the monitor into a state where neither its joystick nor its power button produce any response, and the monitor needs to be unplugged to reboot it. Clearly the monitor's firmware is buggy (I've updated to the latest). Unless this is fixed, I can't give it more than an average rating overall.",14,

Even though I can't run it at full resolution due to my ancient nvidia GT3somthing. Even at 2560x1080, the picture looks great. Usually when you run a monitor lower than it's native res, it looks really grainy. This one, while not as sharp as the full res, does not look all that grainy.
My big problem when I first plugged it in was that my mouse was extremely jumpy. I look all over for help and solutions and found none. Everyone said it was the mouse driver, which I knew wasn't true because when I lowered to 1280x1024, the mouse worked perfectly. Dropping down to lower widescreen resolutions didn't help though. So I spent some time messing around in all the various settings apps and discovered that nvidia, by default, was treating this as a television. Meaning refresh rate was 24hz! No wonder my mouse was so choppy. So I changed it from TV to monitor mode and it brought the refresh rate up to 30hz at 3440×1440 which was better, but still choppy. So I switched to 2560x1080 and that brought the refresh rate to 60hz. And now my mouse is perfect again.
So, I guess I have to get a new computer to take full advantage of this monitor. But Dell or nvidia or microsoft or somebody should change this monitor profile to default to monitor mode. Not TV mode.",2,

The curvature is quite high (large number / less curve) that I find myself turning from side to side instead of moving my body.

I can’t stop looking at it. Lol! Set up is a breeze, was able to do it all on my own in 10-15 mins. I connected it to the display port and I was able to use it right away, no set up needed. No dead pixel, no bleeding, no IPS glow. Day1, it felt a little too big though I am coming from three monitors - 17/19/20”. But the next day it feels normal and it has so much real estate that I don’t miss having multiple monitors. I use the comfort view preset mode and it’s really easy on my eyes. I don’t need to use my blue light glasses anymore. Brightness is really good, I had to reduce mine from 75% to 53% cause 75% was too bright for me that I felt I was getting headaches (I have sensitive eyes to light). I use this monitor for work only - mostly emails and spreadsheets and it’s really pleasant to use. Text is sharp enough for what I am using the monitor for. Can’t complain with the pictures either though I do not use this for photo/video editing. It doesn’t have a speaker but I am planning to get the Dell slim soundbar soon. I haven’t tried the KVM/PIP/PBP features because I don’t have the need to do so as of the moment. My only minor complaint is that it’s hard to reach the ports at the back of the monitor. I have mine set up close to the wall and when I tried to use the HDMI/USB-C cable to test them, I had to move the entire monitor to see and reach the back. Also I wish it’s a little more curved, but I didn’t want to spend $300-$500 more for the Dell U3421WE model. So I decided to go with this P3421W monitor. I really want to stay with Dell monitors because of the quality. I have a sit stand desk and a very stable stand is a must so it won’t fall forward or move everytime I adjust my desk. And 3600R is not bad at all. It’s still comfortable to use, I can still see all corners without moving my head which is important to me cause moving my head left to right (even little movements) strains my neck. I love that height is adjustable, it tilts and swivels too. Makes it easier to customize for a more comfortable position. Yes, I’m very happy with my purchase!",3,

What I love the most of the P3421W is the resolution, build quality and design for a productive setup as its soft curved screen (3800R) provides such uniform visual focus that I can work on my spreadsheets comfortably. I adjusted immediately to its soft curve to the point I did't notice it after a couple of minutes of usage.
The only thing I'm a bit disappointed with and the only reason I don't give 5 stars to this product is that when I connect my Dell XPS 15 via the USB-C port, it doesn't provide enough power to my laptop. Hence, my laptop's system warns me that it couldn't not run at its full capacity. This doesn't happen when connecting laptops with similar features from other brands so I would be expecting a seemlessly Dell user experience. I believe Dell should consider to cover those different power requirements from their own laptops to connect these type of monitors via the USB-C port.",1,

Ultra-wide: I was looking for an ultrawide monitor so that I can have multiple docs or websites opened at once without having to switch between screens. This is really especially for online classes as you can have your meeting up as well as your schoolwork.

USB-C: With the low connectivity macs have these days, USB-C is about the only way to display your screen without using adaptors. Not only does it display my screen but also charges the laptop.

I keep my brightness at 75% and that's more than enough to use throughout the day, sometimes I have to tone it down at night because it's so bright.

Bought the only thunderbolt 4 dock made by Dell. Unfortunately, I cant start the computer with the dock plugged in.

My start up process: 1- power on /2- open laptop since it won't go to monitors until I clear error message /3- clear error message in bios that says dock is trying to provide power to non-power port /4- shut laptop and wait for it to go to sleep. 5/ wake it up again so it boots to external monitors. Same results with or without manufacturer power cord.

It will sound like an exaggeration, but I genuinely spent 3.5 GRUELING HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE. I was passed around to exactly 13 CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENTS. Dell hung up on me multiple times and sometimes just put me on hold until I gave up. The determined that my docking station was not compatible though several agents suggested that it should work fine. They offered to send me the exact same, non-compatible unit as a replacement. The main part of my experience involved an agent from one of three departments (Customer Care, Tech Support or Sales) telling me they could see that my dock was incompatible and that if I talked so someone from another department (one of the 2 others) that they would be able to create the proper notes/documentation/case number that would allow me to return my dock. Eventually, a sweet technician named Kristina offered to stay with me during my handoff to another department so she could help get it resolved. She was no more successful than I was. She asked if we could escalate to a manager and they tech support guy said he could file a claim to escalate the refund process and that someone would call me (not email, I clarified) to help me get this taken care of. Instead, I got a ONE SENTENCE EMAIL a couple days later telling me that I could purchase a dock on their website. He included a link to the docking station section of their website, not to a specific dock that would work.

Now I have PTSD and still no compatible docking station. Dell is terrible. I'm convinced they know how bad they are since I am not able to leave a review for either product on their website.",0,

Also, if your device does not have thunderbolt 4 and you have a lackluster experience with this device, keep in mind running it in USB-C mode will only yield the capability based on the bandwidth of USB-C and not Thunderbolt.

I've had several throughout many years. But I'd never heard anything about Dell laptops. Knowing that Dell makes the best desktops (in my opinion!), I decided to try the laptop. I couldn't believe how fast I fell in love with this laptop. I've had it for over a month now, using it for several hours each day & I have only found 2 problems with it:
The color on the display is dull. Not the correct colors. I mean, I don't know the technical terms for all this, but it seems like the coloring that the display shows, is of low quality. It isn't HDR so it's kind of upsetting. I like to have brilliant color.
The 2nd problem is the keyboard. The keys are cramped together so it's hard for me to type because I have big fingers. I usually type 95 wpm but on this keyboard I make so many mistakes that it's like I can't type at all!! I'd like the keys more spread out. All laptops seem to have cramped keys, but this one is worse.
But, even with those 2 annoyances, I LOVE THIS DELL LAPTOP!!! The price for it was unbelievable! I'm only going to buy Dell's from now on. The customer service is Old School, which means they care. I will add to this in a couple of months so you can see that I will still love my Dell!!
January 22, 2022 - I've had my Dell for almost 5 months now. Like I said, I STILL LOVE MY DELL!! I'm getting used to the keys a little bit but I bought a keyboard & attached it to my laptop & it works great. Like I said in my earlier review, Dell's are the best desktop computers, & now I can honestly say that they make the best laptops too. It's worth it to spend a little more because you'll have your Dell for WAY longer than any other brand. Soooooo, to sum it all up, I LOVE MY DELL LAPTOP!!! LOLOL",29,"樣式: 4GB RAM,128GB SSD"

I suspect due to the 'chip shortage' Dell was forced to dive into the ol' parts bin and ship this particular 3583 with an older - and MUCH lower specs - Pentium Gold 5th generation CPU with limited cache. To try to compensate, Dell also shipped this unit with a M.2 SSD rather than the spec'd spinning HDD. That was very good of them. But the mis-match seems to be creating some lag in 'getting things done', although not critical. I may (probably) be wrong about this, but then I'm not a computer whiz. It would be great if Dell eventually tracked this order and in future shipped us a comparable Core i3 CPU with a realistic cache. Hey, I can dream!

It's not incredibly heavy, but it's certainly not designed as a ""lightweight"" solution.

I was to be working hybrid, home on Tues/Thurs and in the Office MWF. My old laptop was a janky Lenovo from college that just needed to go, so I did some digging and found this laptop. The reviews were solid, and the price wasn't steep at all so I went for the purchase.

Worst. Mistake. Ever. When I say this laptop is slow, this laptop is SLOW. I've done every update possible, checked for out of date drivers and updated the ones that needed updating. I've installed software for security, and mostly use this laptop for work and my own personal work, so nothing dodgy is ever downloaded onto my laptop.

It takes about 5-7 minutes for the initial log-in to load, another 7-10 minutes for the laptop to 'wake up' and what feels like 20 years to load apps, such as Chrome or what have you. Even while typing this review, the lag is just ridiculous. The cursor is currently stuck on the word 'even'........ and it's still stuck there.

Just slow slow slow all around since day one of getting this laptop.

Now here's the kicker... this week and next I'm working from home again, and I decided to check with Dell's website to see if there are any additional driver updates I can find. Now according to the Amazon listing for this laptop, this is a Dell Inspiron 3583. I went to the Dell support website and did a search for the Inspiron 3583, but the website said that this search didn't yield anything. I went to my Amazon orders to make sure I had the correct model, but again the search didn't bring anything up. SO, I put my laptop onto it's monitor to look at the model number that comes on the laptop.......... the laptop I received is AN INSPIRON 3502!?!? Can you say false advertising?????? I'll definitely be filing a complaint with Amazon.

Do yourself a favor, and just skip onto the next laptop if you were considering purchasing this one. I've seen other reviews mentioning just how slow this laptop is, and they are absolutely correct. If you have a 5hr work day, you'll be waiting 7hr just to get this thing slightly up and running. Definitely not a recommended product.",23,"樣式: 4GB RAM,128GB SSD"

Hasn't worked since. I did everything I could do. Contacted Geek Squad. They did what they could do and it worked for 2 weeks. Now back to the same thing. WAY TO MUCH TROUBLE. Back to using a 13 year old laptop with Windows 7 until I can get Windows off and Fire Fox installed. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,0,"樣式: 4GB RAM,128GB SSD"

I barely ever moved the old laptop....it's my work/office set up with a remote bigger monitor and wireless keyboard, so I think this one will just sit in my office too...but it is nice that it is a laptop if I ever DO have to take it on the road with me.

Sheairs Jr.,2.0,2023-05-29 00:00:00,美國,,"This review is for the Dell 2022 Inspiron 15 Laptop, 15.6"" HD Display, Intel Celeron N4020 Processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD.

The laptop arrives with Windows 11 installed. As some other reviewers have stated, the laptop is very very slow out of the box, and it does appear that Windows 11 is the cause. I didn't realize this until it arrived and I tried using it, with poor results. Every simple action took a very long time, so I read the reviews and saw that others were reporting slow response times.

I decided to see if the speed could be improved by installing Windows 10, and it did. It's not a simple process at all, especially if you are not familiar with how to do it. You basically need to create a USB boot disc with the full Windows 10 installation pack loaded, and perform a clean installation of the hard drive, completely wiping out what comes pre-installed. It took me the better part of two days, but once it's done, the system is much more responsive and works with the speed you would assume of a sub-$400 laptop.

Is this a good buy? It really depends if you want to go through the hassle of removing Windows 11 from the unit and putting the effort in. Here's a Tip: Be sure to know what drivers you may need, as I struggled with both monitor and wi-fi drivers at some point during the installation process for Windows 10.

Good Luck!",4,Computer memory size: 16 GB硬碟大小: 1 TB

You can run games such as CS:GO as long as they're not on the highest graphics settings, but my intention was never to run serious games on this.

The laptop housing and keyboard is cheap, and it shows. It doesn't take much pressure to bend the laptop chassis and keyboard. I've had keys get stuck with less than a week of using it. The keyboard also doesn't have a backlight, which is a bummer. With the screen not being able to flip all the way back and convert it to a tablet, I'm not sure what the point is having a touch screen.

The first one arrived and had a defective wireless card and would not connect to a network, which is required to set up Win11 (no ethernet port on this laptop). So I returned it and purchased another one same day as I shipped the return because I could not wait 3 weeks for an exchange. The second one arrived 3 days later and I did manage to get it set up and it worked fine for a couple of days. Then it would no longer power on. Completely dead. Tried leaving it connected to charger overnight. Still dead next morning. So I returned that one as well. And bought an Acer instead (which works great!).

Be careful to review the return policy. Amazon does clearly states the return policy, but buyer beware. Both of my purchases were from Amazon Marketplace sellers, marked with Amazon Prime and ""Shipped from Amazon"". Amazon will not refund computer purchases until after they receive the item back and have time to inspect the product. Then it takes 7 days to go back to your credit card. It is not like most Prime purchases where you get the refund almost immediately after UPS scans the return package.

On my first return, it took 3 weeks. That was from Seller ""Snow Bell"" and I eventually got a full refund. Then the second return took another 3 weeks, so I was carrying $1200 on my credit card while having to purchase a third replacement elsewhere (another $700 on my credit card). And now I am fighting with Seller named ""AmazingDeal Arrived"" on the second return as they are trying to charge me a $231 ""restocking fee"" despite the fact the laptop was damaged/defective and the restocking fee is inapplicable.

I was cautioned by the tech that it is a known issue that Dell does not take responsibility for unless still under warranty which mine was not. The actual part itself might cost $1.00 to make but the fix requires replacing perfectly good parts due to this design flaw. :( I was able to fix it myself but not before spending about $70 and taking the laptop apart as demonstrated in a YouTube video.

I had Dell computers before so I was pretty confident buying this model as soon as it came out. What a mistake! Honestly probably will never buy a Dell again.
Here are the main things that happened since I got this computer exactly one year ago:
1. Screen was screwed up and jittering right out of the box - had to send it to get fixed.
2. Camera is jittery and very low quality, sometimes has a purple ""filter"" that covers the entire screen. I'm the joke of all Zoom calls.
3. The screen frame got stuck on some piece of plastic in the hinge and it got partially pulled off. Had to get it fixed, and now the screen is all crooked.
4. Now the screen is getting stuck again on the other hinge.

Having said that. The computer is lightweight and fast. But still, my recommendation is DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK! You can get the same specs on other computers for the same cost without all this BS.",1,Computer memory size: 32 GB硬碟大小: 1 TB

Lesson learned.

Long story short, I work for a very small non-profit in a rural community. We hired our first employee outside of my position and I purchased a laptop for them to use. The employee started a few weeks after I bought the laptop and started using it minimally (basically just email and internet searches). As his workload and responsibilities increased, he needed to use the laptop more. I ordered him a wireless mouse and keyboard. When we went to plug in the devices, none of the three USB ports worked. We tried various USB devices and no luck. At first I thought it was user error and tried to problem solve, eventually realizing that they just don't work.

It is now about 2.5 months since I received the laptop and I called to see if I can get it fixed or replaced. Amazon connected me with the seller and they said nothing they can do because it is outside of the 30 day window. After, I spoke with Amazon and asked if they would provide a replacement and they declined, as well.

So...now we have a laptop with no USB connectivity. Basically, we just have to deal with it.

I am disappointed and expected better. I understand they have policies about returns, but we clearly received a defective laptop and replacing it for us was the right thing to do.",5,

I have a brand new Dell Inspiron 13 2-in-1 laptop (purchased Aug 2016) with Windows 10 that gets used at my home office desk just as much as it does on the road. I was looking for something that would allow me to have full desktop capability at home by connecting only one cable to my laptop and this fit the bill. I was able to use all of my old (and I do mean old) peripherals - VGA monitor, USB keyboard and mouse - and it worked right out of the box. All of the peripherals get connected to ports on the back of the box which makes for a clean desk space, and the only ports facing front are the ones you might plug/unplug cables from more often: the headphone/headset jack and two USB 3.0 ports. In the back I have my ethernet cable, VGA cable, USB cable for my keyboard, USB dongle for my wireless mouse, USB dongle license key for a software program, and audio cable for my speakers. And the included power supply/power delivery means I can keep my portable power adapter in my laptop case for when I travel and I don't have to purchase a second one for my home office setup.

I'm only using one monitor so I can't speak to its ability to run 2 monitors at once. It has 3 video ports (VGA, mini-DP and HDMI) but I've read you can only use one 4K monitor or 2 lower resolution monitors at the same time. They used to call this a ""Triple 4K Dock"" but they seem to have listened to the complaints about it actually supporting only one 4K monitor and they changed the name.

The unit came with a note about needing to update the computer to the latest BIOS version and WD15 drivers before hooking up this dock. My laptop was new enough to have the latest so I just plugged everything in and it all worked. As a side note, I'm able to leave the laptop closed when it's docked at home. There's a ""sleep"" button on the top front right corner of the dock that puts the laptop to sleep (faster than doing it through several clicks in Windows) and I'm able to wake the laptop by pressing a keyboard key or moving the mouse. It's a laptop configuration that allows you to do this but my point is that the WD15 doesn't prevent the keyboard/mouse signals from reaching the laptop when it's asleep.

These units cost $199 from Dell at the time I wrote this review but I paid only $89 on Amazon. I expected I was not going to get a brand new unit given the price and sure enough it came in an opened box from Kazba so don't be surprised if you get the same. The unit looked new and was in its plastic packaging and as I mentioned it worked great out of the box. So maybe the unit was returned to Dell and resold by Kasba, I don't know. But I think it was a fair price even if it didn't come in a sealed box. And I ordered it on Thursday and received it from Kasba on Monday.",17,

But I bought it and a DELL Inspiron 15 7579. I am totally disappointed with trying to use them together at my desk.

The WD15 does not clear specify the USB -C requirements. The USB-C in this computer is very limited. It does not work with the DELL WD15 docking station (USB-C). More precisely, it partially works. The on/off button does not work at all. You cannot load the WD15 Drivers, because the laptop does not recognize that the device is attached via the USB-C. I had to manually load the drivers for the wired LAN network adapter so that I could use the wired LAN in my house (Dell's app did not recognize and load them when I used their web site to update all drivers).

This incompatibility is not well known at Dell. The first time I called for assistance, they told me the Docking Station was defective and I should return it. I did that, and the replacement had the same problems. Additional calls/additional tech support people tried to help. Finally, after spending 2.5 hours one day and giving the Dell person access to the computer, he gave up and asked for more advanced Tech support. They told him that this Inspiron and WD15 Dock are incompatible in design. This was the first time I received a clear answer about the incompatibility of Dell products. IF they would have told me this on the first call, I would not have returned the WD15, but I would have returned the laptop, and bought one that was compatible. Now I have invested time and money installing and configuring software, so it would be hard to exchange the laptop.

Even though none of the Dell reps were able to tell me that these products were incompatible (only partially worked together), Dell issue resolution has walked away from the problem, and told me there is nothing they will do, and that it is my problem. They say that the root of the problem is in the Inspiron BIOS design. Not an area I would expect to check out when deciding to purchase a product. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with DELL support in both the descriptions supporting purchase of products and follow up Tech Support.

I have attached the picture that I received from Dell, showing me the feature (USB Thunderbolt Configuration) that is MISSING in the BIOS of this Inspiron laptop. Since this feature is not available in the Inspiron BIOS, I was told the dock can not be made to fully work.",32,

I tried it with a new Dell Inspiron 13 2-in-1 (Model 7378), which features a Type-C USB 3.1 Gen2 port supporting DisplayPort Alt Mode and USB Power Delivery. The Dell sales department repeatedly assured me the WD15 and Inspiron 7378 are compatible, even though neither product's web page shows the other in the compatibility listings. They said the web pages were simply out of date.

Some users have reported success with the dock after updating firmware and drivers on both the laptop and dock, as per the dock's instructions. I think this depends on the specific model laptop used. I had no trouble updating the 7378 laptop, but the firmware update utility for the dock claims it's not connected. Dell replaced the dock under warranty, but the new one exhibited the same behavior, after which Dell confirmed it's a known problem with no solution.

It is possible to make the dock work, but the procedure ends up being a cumbersome 6+ cable undocking/docking sequence as follows:
1.) Start with both laptop and dock powered off and disconnected from each other, and all peripherals disconnected from dock.
2.) Power on laptop under battery power and login.
3.) Power on dock.
4.) Connect dock to laptop.
5.) Connect primary monitor to dock.
6.) Connect secondary monitor to dock.
7.) Connect Ethernet to dock.
8.) Connect USB devices to dock.

You are handing cables over 12 times with this procedure cycle! If any part of it isn't followed precisely, you have to power everything down and start over. Sometimes it will appear to work even if you didn't follow the procedure, but then you WILL have problems with the Ethernet and USB devices dropping out, risking data corruption.

If you follow the 6+ cable docking procedure exactly, it works reliably, but what's the point? You'd be better off just connecting the laptop power adapter and an ""old-fashioned"" USB 3.0 dock for everything else.

It's reasonable to believe the problems with the dock are soft issues and could be resolved with a firmware update, so it's really disappointing that Dell hasn't fixed this. My support ticket with Dell ran 30 days, with dozens of email exchanges or phone discussions along with remote control sessions, driver installation/re-installation, and untold reboots. I should have paid attention to the other negative reviews and not wasted my time with this.",4,

Chandler Visher,4.0,2018-02-07 00:00:00,美國,,"This dock comes with either a 130W or 180W adapter, although the Amazon description at the time I bought it said was 180watt in one place and 130 in another, so I did not realize that Dell had two docks with the same model number but different power adapters. When I plugged in my Dell XPS 9560 with the 130 watt adapter I got a message that it would not charge because required more power, so would have to use the laptop's power cord while in the dock to avoid battery going down. I sent it back for the 180 watt, which works fine. I am using with dual VGA monitors. Although it will support 4k, I think it will only allow one monitor at that resolution, as when the resolution was set to 4k only one monitor would work, so I had to set to lower resolution. This is fine for me, as I don't have 4k monitors although the laptop is 4k, but I would check Dell's website if you want to use two 4k monitors to see if this supports that. It was by talking to Dell and looking at Dell's list of docks which support my laptop that I realized Amazon description was wrong, as the Dell website says you have to have the 180 watt version..",13,

The TB16 is horrible. Then we tried this. In short: THIS WORKS.

There were no special drivers, no special setup - just plug it in. Unlike the other docks, this has no moving parts, no fans. It's small, had plenty of ports, performs well, and just works. You can use two digital monitors (ie you're not stuck with 1 DVI and one VGA like previous Dell docks) by using the HDMI port and the miniDVi port. Of course there are resolution limits, as with anything, you can check the specs on Dell's site to see what resolutions it supports.

This one comes with a 130W PS, but really you can use any Dell PS that has enough power for all your stuff. Just add up the numbers and subtract power for the dock itself (about 40w).

If you have a Dell laptop, it supports MAC address passthrough, which is nice for business so you can do MAC address filtering on your switches or whatever.

It does work on other USB-C computers, but no guarantee on which ones. We tested it and it worked on the newer Macbook / Macbook Pro and some other non-Dell laptops.

As far as quality, I did not notice any issues... no video lag, no connectivity issues, network issues, dock/undock issues... nothing. It just works.",6,

I love that it has enough USB ports for my mouse, keyboard, and phone, with plenty to spare. I really like that I can run my two external monitors through it. It charges my dell precision m5510 very well. It's not quite as fast as the power cord, but it's close. I do get a warning from the BIOS about it being a 95W power supply when booting to windows though.

The biggest bit of awesomeness is that I went from 5 things to plug in every time I sit down at my desk to one thing to plug in.

My only complaints:
- The cord for the dock comes out of the left side, and has to bend to go in the left side of my laptop (where the USB-C port is)
- Sometimes the signal sent to my 1920x1200 external monitor makes the text blurry. I'm using a DVI cord attached to a DVI to mini display-port adapter

After talking to Amazon which was NO HELP, they transferred me to Dell.

- HDMI Port compatible with 4K resolution. I was worried I'd have to use DP for that (and didn't have a cable handy). Worked fine w/ HDMI.

The Bad:
- You have to manually turn the dock on when you connect your laptop to USB-C. It should automatically wake up without user intervention.
- You need to download/update drivers from Dell's website to get it to work.
- You need to update your laptop's video, audio, and i/o drivers from Dell's website before you get it to work.
- The USB ports are not all high-power (2.0-2.4 amps). If you connect devices that require more current (e.g. iPad or another tablet), you have to connect it to the correct port. In 2016, all of the USB-A ports should be USB 3.0 w/ 2.4 A of power.

It does replace the power supply (XPS laptop), so there is no duplication of this feature. As I have seen with most Dell products it looks to be well made and durable.

An update to my review. This Dock is completely useless, at least for a Dell XPS13. What ever you do either do not by this dock and try using it with a Dell XPS13 or don't buy a XPS13.

I have a Dell 30"" monitor with a resolution of 2560x1600 and it works fine with the MacBook using a Thunderbolt3->Thunderbolt2 adapter from Apple. There are 2 problems with this dock:

1) The maximum resolution supported over the minidisplayport (out) connection is 1600x1200. It will not work with my monitor. Minidisplayport from the dock to a DVI adapter yields only slightly better results of 1920x1200. Again - all of these cables/adapters work fine at the max resolution of 2560x1600 using the apple adapter

2) The power charging only provides 58 watts. I double checked with Dell support - if you have a non-Dell laptop, the dock will never put out more than 60 watts. While this isn't a problem for the 13"" MacBook Pro (2016 model), it will NOT sufficiently power the 15"" MacBook Pro (2016 model) which I am considering getting

The dock was originally $XXX and is now selling for $XX and my guess is that it is because of these compatibility type of issues.",4,

ok so going off that topic, basically when i first unboxed this monster of a monitor i was coming from a 24” 60hz 1080 dell glossy screen finish monitor. and i was blown away. just putting this screen in front of you without even turning it on is really cool. the curve and ultra wide size is no joke. it’s like putting vr goggles on for first time. it genuinely feels like ur driving a race car simulation set up where u are fully immersed. now i wanna say as cool as this is. after the first couple weeks it genuinely became more of a cumbersome aspect than a cool one. i mean u remember getting your first console or your first car and after a few weeks instead of being happy u own it every day u complain about little things or just get used to it? ya everything is like that but this is even further to where i considered returning it. i mean i couldn’t tell why i didn’t like it but looking back now i realize it’s that when we use our eyes to see things most of the time we keep our eyes straight and move our head. we aren’t chameleons where we move our eyes all around. ik this sounds funny but it’s true. i found that even tho i had a huge wide screen i never really saw it. our peripheral vision is genuine but it’s not good enough for this use case. i found that instead of enjoying the wider screen. i was more unsatisfied with the lack of height of the screen, because hear me out: when our eyes are straight forward we are going to see the top and bottom of the screen more than the left and right side. so i started wishing that i actually had a taller screen. now i took it upon myself to do research and i found a website that compares screen sizes. it turns out that a 34” 21:9 ultrawide monitor is the exact same height of screen as a 27” 16:9 normal size monitor. now you might not be able to understand what i’m saying but it’s like taking a medium size monitor such as 27” and all u do is pull the sides out. it basically means that the ratio is no longer balanced. although the immersion was great with the curved wide screen. i started thinking it would be much more enjoyable to have a curved “normal” screen such as a 32” 16:9 or even a 27” 16:9. now when i compared a 32” 16:9 monitor to a 27” 16:9 and 34” 21:9 on the website, it turns out a 16:9 32” is taller in height screen wise than both of the other two, while the horizontal length is in between those 2. again, a 27” 16:9 and 34 21:9 monitor have the exact same screen height. just different width. so what i’m getting to is that if you want a “big immersive experience”... i do not recommend buying a 34” 21:9 monitor. i just don’t. i recommend buying a 16:9 monitor. either get a curved 27” 16:9 or a curved OR flat 32” (or bigger...) now i want to talk about gaming. i came from 1080p 60hz 24” dell monitor so i thought i would be way better at my favorite games like fortnite and rocket league and etc. but the weirdest thing was that somehow i was worse. i finally realized why. it’s because when you have such a big screen you can’t actually see everything that’s shown on the screen at once. ironically the small size of the 24 was making me play competitive games better. go figure. ya sure the immersion of the 34 was great. i mean playing fortnite in ultrawide for first time was like logan paul putting his color blind glasses on for the first time. i was questioning my entire life, “how have i never tried this before?”, i kept asking myself. now as enjoyable as this was, it was equally and extensively more impractical. think of it this way: the reason i wanted ultrawide for gaming was not just immersion for playing story games like the witcher or gta or whatever. no, i wanted it for a competitive advantage. quite frankly i wanted to “cheat”. when u have more horizontal space on a screen it means u can literally see more of the game around you. now i thought this would help me, obviously. i thought that when i was behind a wall in fortnite or whatever game, that i could peak around the corner without the enemy seeing me and i could basically just screen peak everywhere. well let me just keep it real, it doesn’t actually help you in any way. imagine in a 15 minute match i may peak around a corner in fortnite like 1 or 2 times, i just never actually found myself using this “feature”. and when i did i didn’t think it actually resulted in me “winning the fight” or having a real advantage. but not just that. i actually found it may diminish my skill and experience. for example, i found myself being more lazy in the game. it required less input from me to look around. but this is not smart because instead of having good spacial awareness and flicking your mouse side by side to see what’s to your left and right i could see it all at the same time. but what this means is that you’re essentially multi tasking. and we should all know by now multi tasking is essentially doing multiple tasks with little to no success. i was overwhelmed with on screen input and found myself playing worse somehow. i realize now that it’s better to have a smaller screen to be able to focus on the whole screen at one time (instead of a small portion of a big screen) so that you can concentrate much better and therefor execute tasks to fruition even though it might not look as cool or immersive. now i know it’s better to swipe your view point by way of your mouse or joystick than with your head/eyes. the amount of time it takes to look to the left or right of screen with your head or eyes is longer and more cumbersome than if u had a smaller 16:9 screen and just moved your mouse (or controller) to the left or right to see what’s next to you. now ik i might sound crazy or i’m making a stretch but that is genuinely my thoughts on why i play worse. (even with higher refresh rate 144hz)
even after i got my aw2721d and gigabyte m27x 1440p 27” 240hz monitor, i realized that i play a little better and am more focused on a 24” size because of the small size. now i’m not saying it’s worth going 1080p just to have a small screen. let’s be real 1440p is a lot better for story games battle royals n desktop use so u might as well be at 27 and get used to the size. but i mean still the smaller the better. now imagine going 34”
now the next reasons why i loved this monitor were also it’s biggest downfall. when compared to my ips 24” 60hz 1080p monitor, i was impressed, to say least, of the black levels. just when i had spotify open on my desktop the black parts of the tab were actually so black it looked like a void and when i moved the spotify tab over to the ips panel all i could see is grey black. this va panel ruined standard ips for me lol. it really made a difference back to back. not just a little better but it made it more enjoyable to just use the pc. i loved it. and even though va panels supposedly don’t “pop” the same as ips as far as colors i would say i almost think it’s possible they pop more because of the sheer level of contrast. a red color might be more red on a ips. but compared to light grey black levels, a bright red looks meh. whereas compared to deep black levels, a medium red would look bright and punchy, do you understand at all? and also i’d like to mention. The colors also looked really good. i didn’t notice it was “va” or anything like that. i wouldn’t complain about the colors of this va once i had the right settings on it.
i think va blacks are worth it.
but here’s the problem. now va has bad viewing angles right? and i didn’t know exactly what it meant till i tried it. when ips panel is not exactly on center with your vision what happens is that u see ips glow or backlight bleed where basically the dark parts of the corners become a lot lighter when viewing from sides. this is annoying but it doesn’t affect the actual colors. now if you don’t view a va panel from directly head on perfect center it’s the actual colors that are affected. it’s literally like they got washed out like chalk on the sidewalk. i can’t stress enough how big of an impact this makes. on ips it’s a gripe, an annoyance, whereas on va it’s a down right issue, it’s a legitimate deal breaker. and i mean that. now you might think, well why wouldn’t i be looking straight at my screen? if i’m looking the correct way the va panel won’t matter. i’m sorry but even i was corrected here. you see because the monitor is not small like 24 inches the edges become off axis from your straight line of sight. now this is why va panels are curved. so that it corrects the line of vision to go straight to your eyes. now here’s the good and bad. yea it does work and it pushes the edges to be straight to your eyes from the middle of screen to the very side. and yeah it makes a immersive cockpit feel. but here’s the downside. you not only have to be looking from straight on, you have to be an exact distance away from the monitor for there to be no off axis viewing of the corners. now what does this mean? basically this monitor has a curve. some are 1000 some are 1500 this is 1800. now u might think it’s smart it’s not as crazy of a curve of 1000 but here’s the problem. i found that i had to sit back away from the monitor from a distance farther than i actually wanted to. when you are looking at the monitor from close up it really surrounds you and gives a great feeling of being in a cockpit or a simulation right?. well once u back up a foot or two what happens is now you see the top and bottom of the screen. now ur looking at a wide screen instead of looking into a wide screen. and it just doesn’t work. it diminishes the whole experience. and hear me out, this is where the vertical height of the screen really stands out as a weak point. it’s just not tall enough. it’s not a good ratio and i’m sorry to ultrawide lovers out there. but if you want an ultrawide 21:9 monitor this means to me that you HAVE to go ips. (so that you can sit in close to the monitor) i’m serious. the viewing angles are a deal breaker here. i found myself playing chill fun games even like age of empires but kept being disappointed and distracted by how all sides of the screen had these bland and dead colors. imagine red being brown. that’s what it’s like and it RUINS the ultrawide. i mean why on earth are you buying a 21:9 screen so that you can have more horizontal screen, and then that extra screen is rendered useless and cumbersome because it’s washed out because you want to sit closer to be immersed into the screen? sure you can sit farther back or put it on a monitor arm and keep it far away… but for me to essentially be strapped into one exact seating position feels really limiting. it feels like you’re just not getting what u paid for, it sucks quite frankly. i’m sorry.
now i haven’t tried them yet, but i think something like a 1000r curve 32” or 27” 16:9 for a VA panel could actually work. this is because the sides won’t. e as wide as the 21:9 and it is chore strongly curved inward for you to be able to sit closer. but again, i haven’t tried it so i can’t say.
now also let me get to next point. those deep black level lovers out there such as myself there is hope for us. now i recently got two 1440p 240hz ips 27” monitors from gigabyte and alienware. and no joke as much as i like them, as good as they are, they’re terrible grey level blacks and ips glow and ips back light bleed ruin these displays. now i don’t wanna be super gloomy but it’s a genuine issue. and i don’t hear enough people talk about it. reviews online basically dismiss it as just a “side affect” of ips technology. and u know what. we don’t have to accept it. the same way we don’t HAVE to accept matte screen finishes.
so even tho the va black levels made a great picture quality, the sheer size of the sides of the monitor became cumbersome, not only for every day use of browsing the web but of playing games. i felt like it took up too much of the desk for just casual browsing and then when i wanted to take advantage during games it just made me play worse and i noticed the corner colors washed out a lot. so i would think regularly about how i’d rather have a taller display and a secondary monitor on the side. i also started thinking about 4k because i could notice the pixel density a lot on this 1440p display. on a 34” screen 1440p is just not enough.
so over time i started to dislike the dell 34” 21:9 more and more and then one day fate took it’s turn. all jokes aside, there was an earthquake where i live.a very strong one that shook everything in the whole house. the earthquake was genuinely so strong it shook and knocked over my dell 34” uktrawide monitor…. idk what it hit but it hit something… and now half the screen is literally shattered. not physically but internally somehow. when i turn the screen on it has red and green lines going horizontally across the screen and 1/4 the left side of the screen is cut off and amd turned to static like an old tv lol. so this really was a blessing and a curse. i lost $400 :( but it also gave me an excuse to get a new monitor.. which i was excited for!
now here’s my recommendations for everyone reading:
if u swear by 21:9 ultrawide and u don’t really care what i say or u want to try it for yourself. go for it. really go for it. but i strongly encourage you not to get this one. please just get an ips ultrawide. or a va with a stronger curve. because this screen is so wide the viewing angle issue is much more of an issue than a smaller screen and this 1800r curve isn’t strong enough to fix it. maybe a 1500r curve would be enough but i haven’t tested it, like on the new coolermaster 34” ultrawide VA has 1500r curve but honestly i’d guess it’s probably pretty similar. i’d go ips for 21:9 so u can really sit in your display. now i personally wouldn’t even recommend that because i think you’re better off getting a curved 27 or 32” 16:9 monitor for immersion but that’s just me. or u can get a big flat display like the 40” innocn, however it’s only 1440p and let’s be honest at 32” or above you really do need 4k. and to that you should probably have a rtx 3080 if u want to run 4k 144hz. so u can go 4k if u play easy to run games or mostly use your monitor for media consumption. (unless u have an expensive graphics card go crazy) (but also u can always run a 4k monitor on 1440p for games). so pick what u want, live your life king.
now if u are like me. u play games u watch movies. even for spotify lol, u know deep blacks are worth it… but u don’t know what size to get? i would recommend u look at mini led ips. now oled is out there and va is out there. but from what i’ve researched 2023 is the year for mini led. there is innocn 4k 27 and 32 m2v. they will give u black levels and ips quality. there is cooler master gp27q which will give u mini led 1440p 27 ips and gp27u gives you 4k 27 ips. and then ktc has a 27” 1440p va and 4k ips 27” monitor. the ktc 27” 4k mini led is the same one that’s in coolermaster gp27u. ok now i wanna say if u only care about gaming. like u wanna have best advantage in cod or fortnite or valorant go with a 24” and at that point u have to stick with 1080p but it’s worth it. u can get the zowie 2566 360hz or the 2546 240hz or acer nitro 390hz or even a viewsonic 31 something 240hz is really good for backlight strobing and u will play best on those.
but if u want what i want and that’s more height than a 27” u have only one choice. 32”. it’s big. i know it’s a lot. but go 32” and go 4k. go mini led. ips 144hz and u can’t go wrong. i know it’s a lot of money. but innocn 32 m2v is $850 on amazon right now. that’s what i went with. i haven’t received it yet. but i’m genuinely confident it’s the answer. now if money is an issue… if u don’t have $900. if u have $500 go with a 1440p 27” monitor. don’t bother with 240hz. just get a curved va or get a mini led for the black levels. the coolermaster gp27q is $500 and will give u an insane hdr experience. the ktc is $500 and va so i would be weary of it for the viewing angles. now if u only have like $300. u can get the viewsonic 240hz ips or the acer nitro 390hz ips for between $250-350. and if u want ultrawide go for the va coolermaster 34 if the 1500r curve works better or just get an lg ips. anyways i know it’s long review and i’ve never done it before but i wanted to warn u. even as cool as ultrawide is. it’s just not worth it. get your “dream” monitor. and then put a cheap 24” 1080p monitor next to it. i mean seriously. having 2 is better than 1, i promise. honestly what i could recommend is u could even get a gorgeous display like a 1440p 27” mini led for $500 for story games and youtube/movies as your main, and then get a 24” 1080p 240-360hz for $300 for your second which can obliterate first person shooters and you would have the ultimate setup.
i just got the 32” 4k innocn m2v because after using an ultrawide 1440p 144hz dell 21:9 34”
i was so impressed by how massive it was, i fell in love. but then i fell out of love because of the quirks and impracticality the 21:9 format presented. but then after trying to switch to 27” 1440p 240hz ips for getting the “most competitive edge” because i play games i’m not the best but i enjoy winning and i wanted to have most smooth experience and best chance to win. but after thoroughly testing 240hz vs 144hz i swear to you there is a very hard time telling any difference. if i was shroud i would need 240. but i’m not and never will be. i would rather get deep inky blacks and better picture quality to enjoy my monitor when i’m not playing games 50% time. and after using 27” i felt like it was harder to be as competitive in games as my 24”. even tho the 24” is only 60hz being able to get right up to screen and still see every part of screen helps a lot for vision and reaction. and 27” felt like i was goldilocks didnt fit quite right. it is nice don’t get me wrong. it’s bigger than 24 and it’s 1440p but i felt like i am missing something. i can never quite get the viewing distance right. its not mini led and it’s either too far away and looks small or it’s up to my face and i can’t see corners of screen and they get washed out from ips glow. so this leads to what i believe to be the cure to my disease. if i go 4k 32” 16:9 144hz. i will get the added height of screen over both 27 and 34 21:9 sizes which i wanted. and i won’t have to be looking side to side and it will have 138ppi clarity because of the 4k while maintaining 144hz and i can then lay back in my bed and watch movies and youtube because it’s basically a tv at 32 inches. idk if you guys forgot but 32” used to be a normal size for tvs btw. and with the mini led tech it is darker than a va panel. i mean i hope i’m not wrong once i get this thing in the mail. but i hope i could help steer u guys in a better direction. peace and love your best self, j",274,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

The image was larger, true, and it offered some benefits, but the resolution, the pixel density, as well as number of colors, was not there. Plus, it was actually a little too large, like watching a movie in the front row. If you’re eyeballing your big TV and wondering how well it will work as a monitor, don’t try it. It will only be good for playing videos on the computer.

I needed a real monitor, but I needed one larger than my original monitor. So once again, there I was shopping on Amazon. I settled on this one because of the size and the resolution. So many monitors these days have a max of 1080p. I remember way back in the early 2000s, my monitors going higher than that. At least, I think. Well, 2560 x 1440 is what the doctor ordered. This is not merely a gamer’s monitor. It is an animator’s monitor, at a higher resolution. Acres and acres of screen so that I don’t really need to have two monitors any longer. I love it. It’s just on the edge of being too large. The look and feel of the monitor is quality. This thing is serious.

After a year of an ONN monitor that I didn’t really like because it didn’t have proper contrast, and a second Dell monitor that was slightly smaller, old, and dying, I was finally back to quality. It’s almost frightening because my animations look so much better now that I hope the final product looks as good to people who see my work.

The reason I use two monitors at work and at home is because there’s not enough room on one screen for all my tools. Generally, increasing the monitor size doesn’t help, because only so much information can fit on a screen. But in this case, the screen is bigger AND the resolution is higher, so more information can indeed be placed on the screen. I no longer need two monitors! I have my two work monitors and this huge Dell monitor. Well, honestly, there’s not much more room left on my desk for a second personal monitor anyway.

I’ve only included one screen shot to impress upon you the amount of information that can be squeezed onto the screen. On a 1080p monitor, and perhaps on a 1440p monitor, but smaller, the screenshot will look crowded, but it’s perfectly comfortable now. Normally, I always have the timeline at the bottom hidden, because it takes up too much room, and I need the viewport larger. Here, everything is comfortable, and my old eyes have no problem seeing all the information.

I’m also finding that I don’t tend to go on full screen as much on YouTube, but I will probably end up switching to the dark mode, because all that white can be blinding. It’s a bright monitor, and it’s a dark monitor. The contrast is excellent. I would buy this monitor again in a heartbeat. I almost talked my daughter into buying the replacement that I was going to send back, but she just has no room for it until she moves.

Speaking of replacement, I had a rocky start though. This speaks nothing to the quality control of the hardware itself. The original monitor was just left in my driveway by USPS, just minutes before a sketchy guy came to buy my car. If the neighbor’s dog hadn’t barked, I wouldn’t have stepped out to see the box… left just ten feet from an unused doorbell.

But here comes the real rockiness and it sort of embarrasses me because I’m a tech guy. I’m NOT that customer who calls tech support because he forgot to plug in a device. I swear, I’m not that guy!
The first monitor arrived with no instructions, and I couldn’t turn it on. I checked cables, and power strips. Amazon offered only general advice for idiots on connecting a monitor and (choking) making sure it’s on. And, this is also key, it was in the box upside down. Remember! This is my alibi.

A simple instruction manual or quick start guide would have shown me the nearly invisible power button on the bottom right. And now that I think of it, that power button is in the same place, invisible, on my two newest TVs, though there is a RED LIGHT to alert you that there is the button. The red light goes away when the TVs are on. This monitor has no such illumination of the power button. It only lights up when it’s ON, not off. But all I had was a warranty slip, and the power button was all but hidden on the bottom. I tried every permutation of the prominent unlabeled buttons on the back, and nothing.

I thought that the first monitor was dead and called in for a replacement. The replacement came, and by sheer chance, as I tilted the properly packaged one out of the box, there was the faint gray power button! It was literally the FIRST THING I SAW!

The replacement came with a no-words uni-language hieroglyphics quick guide for setup that was missing in the first one, that also had a callout for the power button. My heart sank. I went back and checked the original. There was the power button! It had worked all along. There was nothing wrong with it. The final hieroglyphic showed a disc and a hardcover book and a webpage and a down arrow. I checked with Indiana Jones, and he told me that this cryptic message meant to download the user guide from dell.com/s2722dgm for further information.

Dell spent a ton of money on more than adequate packaging for this monitor. A whole tree died to deliver it. It came with an extra HDMI cable, which was nice. I would have traded the shiny box, which I’m just going to toss out, for maybe one more 8.5x11 sheet of paper to get me up and running. There was also plenty of white space on the outside of the box for all the info I needed. Just a picture of the power button, because when you look at the back of the monitor, the joystick button makes you think it MUST be the power button. Poor packaging ended up costing Dell and Amazon. How I wish I had gone ahead and googled an online manual, but I was so depressed that it didn’t work that I just waited on the replacement.

But the next debacle is all my fault. I thought that the replacement was defective. I couldn’t insert the HDMI into the HDMI 1. The problem was my orientation. I had my head upside down, looking, and then righted myself, my mind inverted left and right, and I was trying to insert into the display port and not the HDMI port. I used HDMI 2 and loved it. So, when I returned the perfectly fine replacement, I mentioned that the HDMI 1 was damaged, when it wasn’t. Some guy at the Amazon returns department is going to call me an idiot. One had to be returned, so it wasn’t a real issue.

But overall, I love this monitor. I’m spoiled to it, and don’t want to go back to regular monitors. It shouldn’t be called a gaming monitor. It’s a workstation monitor. Love it to death.",133,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722DGM

My plan had been to at some point move from 1440p to 4k once I upgraded from my RX6800, but after seeing some stuff on Ultrawides, I decided that even though it's not really a step up in resolution from 1440p (except side to side), going Ultrawide would make more of a difference for me in games and on the desktop than just an increase in resolution like 4k. Sure, 4k would look sharper, but I'd still be having the same game experience, while with Ultrawide I actually see more on the screen.

1440p Ultrawide is also easier to run than 4k, so that's another benefit, and I don't sit so close to the monitor that I can see any issue with 1440p not being sharp enough.

In any case, as far as the monitor goes, I am very happy with it. I'm not sure I can comment on the VA panel not being as vibrant as my old IPS panel, while I did have the old IPS one configured and just have the VA set to one of the color modes, I am not seeing anything that makes me think, ""Man, my old IPS monitor looked better than this...""

As far as ghosting, I haven't noticed any with the monitor set to Super Fast mode, testing in various games (CP2077, Witcher 3, NFS Unbound, SWJ: Survivor, RDR2, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands). I have had to turn down some game settings here and there to try and maintain my FPS, but that is something I knew would happen considering I moved from 2560x1440 to 3440x1440 without making a GPU upgrade.

I am also loving the lack of backlight bleed on the VA panel. When the screen goes dark the black levels are just darker than on my old IPS panel, and when the screen goes dark for loading screens or things like that, I no longer have brighter spots in the corners or edges, it's all uniform. I love that. (not as dark as OLED obviously, but I also don't have to worry about burn in) I included shots of the black uniformity test between the two Dell monitors from Rtings as an example of what I'm talking about.

I also don't have any issues with the viewing angles. Even when I stand off to the side I can still see what's on the monitor fine, and when I sit in front of the monitor as I always do when actually using my computer, I have not seen any issues with poor viewing angles during regular use.

As a whole, the gaming experience does feel more immersive with the wider natural field of view (in some games like SWJ: Survivor I actually had to reduce the FOV settings because it was getting too stretched on the far edges). I am getting used to the monitor's slight curve on the desktop, which I don't see the benefit of for everyday use, but in game I don't notice the curve at all, and for all I know it might actually be helping with the wide view immersion in that situation.

Overall I'm very happy with my decision to go ultrawide with this VA panel, especially since with at least this specific monitor I am not noticing the drawbacks people at times complain about with VA panels with this monitor, ghosting, poor viewing angles and the colors not being as good as IPS. I'm sure if I had a way to measure colors, response times and ghosting and all the other stuff I'd see a difference (I know there is some just by looking at the RTings reviews), but to my eye when in use I see no problems.",26,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

The 144hz refresh rate ensures a silky smooth framerate, making every motion on the screen appear incredibly fluid. This feature makes it a jewel for gaming with a compentent card, allowing for an immersive experience that's hard to parallel. Every game feels more alive and responsive, making it a staple for any gaming setup. If this is your first time gaming with an ultrawide, it will be hard to go back!

But the advantages don’t stop at gaming; it’s also a productivity powerhouse. The ultrawide screen is a game changer, allowing for seamless multitasking and providing ample space to have multiple windows open side by side. This has proven invaluable for my workflow, enabling me to manage my tasks more efficiently and with greater ease.

Aesthetically, it's a visual treat. It looks great on the desk, adding a touch of sophistication to my workspace. The vibrant and sharp display makes every color pop, making it a joy to work on. Additionaly, for movie watching, there are no more black bars on the top and bottom as the aspect ration of the monitor fits the movie picture.

In conclusion, Dell’s 34 inch ultrawide monitor is a blend of affordability, convienence, and performance. It’s immersive for gaming, a boon for productivity, and a delight to look at. Highly recommended for anyone looking to elevate their visual experience!",0,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

I've had several monitors now and this is my first ultrawide one. I was initially worried it would be too big for me or cause neck pain from looking at both ends of the screen, especially when gaming, but I can tell you that is not a problem here. It's a beautiful monitor with the right amount of curvature and adjustability to fit my needs. It promises on all of its advertised features and offers choices to accommodate what a lot of gamers look for in a high-end monitor. Before buying though, you'll want to make sure your PC can handle it. I have an RTX 2080, and this monitor is pretty much the best I can get with it, and I can't tell much of a difference in power draw or graphics quality (This monitor replaces a 2560x1440 curved one, which was still an amazing monitor, too).

Now, to the design flaw I mentioned in the title, and the main reason I'm writing this; to give a little PSA on a weird quirk of the monitor. There are four settings available for response time: Fast, Super-Fast, Extreme, and MPRT. MPRT is 1ms response time and is what I prefer to use. However, every time I turn my PC on or wake it up from sleep, the response time resets to Fast. Every. Single. Time. A quick message from the monitor will pop up for 10 seconds or so when booting up saying that the refresh rate is too low and needs to be 100Hz or higher to use MPRT. You're probably thinking the Hz is too low, then, and so did I. But lo and behold, the Hz has not changed AT ALL from 144Hz when I go to check. I have to manually change the response time to MPRT (buttons on the side of the screen) for every power on or waking up. Oh yeah, and when it resets to Fast, the screen brightness goes down. You can see the screen get visibly brighter when putting it back to MPRT.

I contacted Dell support and they were troubleshooting with me for over a month. Their final conclusion was that it is working as intended. What? I can see why the monitor does this: in the split second it's turning on, its going from 0Hz to 144Hz and so it thinks that you can't have MPRT on when it's below 100Hz. So, it resets it, telling you to up your refresh rate to get MPRT back. But, come on... really? It's not a deal-breaker but is so annoying. I'm on my computer every day and I have to have a sticky note on the monitor to remind me to change it. Even then, I still forget! I'm sure a lot of people will read this and go ""Oh, first world problems! You're entitled, don't be lazy, etc."". Normally I'd agree, but this is a $500 ultrawide monitor with all the bells and whistles and comes from a well-known brand. I have a second, $200 monitor that does everything this one can but has never reset any of the settings. I've owned a $100 one that also does the same thing with no resetting. The only difference is resolution and size. I don't think it's laziness to expect an expensive product with a lot of good features to work correctly and not need manual input and handholding on a daily basis. Not to mention going from no worries on all my previous monitors to having to think about response time every day and wondering why my screen looks dimmer.

TLDR: Best monitor I've ever had and I'm glad to have made the decision to get an ultrawide. Has all the features it advertises. Amazing for gaming or any use. Only flaw/annoyance is that your response time may reset every time your PC turns on or wakes up from sleep; a lower response time will also dim the screen. You have to manually change it back each time. Not really a big enough reason to not buy it, but certainly something I thought others should be aware of.

UPDATE 6/12/2022: I recently upgraded my graphics card from an NVIDIA RTX 2080 to a 3080. Since doing that, the monitor no longer resets the refresh rate. I tried replicating the issue and it now stays at MPRT. I have no idea why the graphics card would affect that, but here we are. Maybe I had a setting somewhere that was reset upon installing the 3080? Or my PC needed a little more power in order to remember the setting? I'm happy that I don't have to remember to change the refresh rate every time, but it's weird that this was a fix.

UPDATE 11/28/2022: The response time issue came back. If I have my timeline correct, it reappeared when I got a new PSU for my PC which was shortly after getting my 3080. There's got to be a setting somewhere that fixes all of this but I've tried everything I can think of. Still a fantastic monitor, but this is pretty annoying.",145,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

There are a lot of positive talking points to discuss about this Dell curved monitor and some minor negatives or miss steps on their part, but before that a quick few words about the packing and presentation of the monitor. The monitor comes from Amazon in its original retail box, which is an issue, because it is not double boxed and not extra protected, it's prone to sustain some major damages during transportation, and that is exactly what happened to the first unit that was delivered to my house, upon inspection, the monitor screen was completely shattered inside, luckily Amazon was super fast to replace it and the second one came intact.
Dell's retail box is well designed with some images of the product inside and some of the most important features and specs outlined as well, unfortunately the packing insulation inside is not the best, the monitor is only separated with recycled cardboard and there is almost no foam protection. On the top side of the cardboard, there are the power cable, HDMI cable and the DVI cable, in addition to a small user manual and a warranty card. Inside and sandwiched between the two cardboard isolators is the monitor, the base of the stand and the monitor stand.

Positives:

- Great screen resolution and refresh rate - 2560x1440 is currently my favorite screen resolution for gaming, this partnered with 165Mhz refresh rate and 1-2 milliseconds response time, is a recipe for a good gaming experience.
- AMD FreeSync, but most of all nVidia G-Sync technologies on board - FreeSync is great, but I was very pleasantly surprised to see that nVidia G-Sync was available as well! G-Sync was not mentioned anywhere, not on the box and not on the Amazon page, but G-Sync is on and working, attaching some screenshots from my GPU control panel.
- Display port 1.2 and HDMI 2.0x2, 3.5mm headphone jack on board - great options for input, with the DP 1.2 you can use the max 165Hz and with the HDMI 2.0 the max is 120Hz. I would recommend to everyone to use the DP cable and port as you will be enjoying the maximum potential of this monitor.
- Cables included - a lot of monitors are being sold without the DP or HDMI cable in the box, and this one is providing both.
- Matte screen - no glare, no reflections on the screen, the picture is clear and crisp.
- 99% Srgb and 350 nits of brightness - making this monitor not only good for gaming but for content creation as well.
- High quality metal base and monitor stand - although I am using a dual monitor arm on my desk and I am not using the monitor stand that comes in the package, that stand is actually pretty good with a sturdy solid base and numerous adjustment positions.
- Narrow side bezels, making the picture even more immersive and the monitor more compact.
- Some good and useful options on board - Timer, FPS Counter and Dark Stabilizer, plus switching between the different panel speeds directly from the menu as well.
- No RGB on this monitor - thank Dell, there is just a single small blue led light throwing light downwards under the monitor over your desk, nothing too distracting.

Negatives:

- It's still a VA panel - No IPS or anything better as a technology, so there are some picture compromises, but still better than TN panels.
- Curved - now I am not still sold on the curved as a benefit, I would probably love those specs to come in a regular flat panel, but that is just me, some people might love the curved panel.
- 2ms response time, if you want to benefit from G-Sync and FreeSync, if you set it to 1ms response time, those technologies become unavailable.
- No HDMI 2.1 or DP 1.4 on board
- A bit heavy as the power delivery is built into the monitor and is not on a separate power source.
- Somewhat expensive - at $300, and considering the VA tech, I think that Dell is pushing it too much, at $250 this monitor would have been easily recommendable and more competitive.

Overall, I like this monitor so far, it was a good step up from my previous 1080P 144Hz monitor, I can definitely see the difference in the GPU performance finally.",157,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2722DGM

I frequently have multiple remote sessions going, this monitor's resolution lets me pull up two remote screens and work on them side by side on my display.
For gaming, I'm upgrading from 1080p 165hz monitor driven by a geforce 1660ti to this screen, which is a perfect pairing for my 4090. CoD, Diablo, Destiny 2, Civ 5 all look fantastic.
This 34"" monitor was on sale for Prime Day at ~$350 US, close to what I spent on it. At that price point, it's a steal. I dont know if I'd pay full price otherwise.
I was able to use a dual vertical vesa mount stand for this, above which I placed my 27"" 1080p monitor - there is no room between the two, so i opted to rotate the top monitor 180 so the control buttons faced the ceiling instead of the floor, just for easier control access, and changed the screen rotation in Windows.

Visually things look great and it has a ton of visual flexibility. I highly suggest download the ICC profile (you can find this on rtings.com).

Unfortunately, when I set it to the fastest response time the ghosting gets really bad, much much worse than my other VA panel, Samsung Odyssey G5. Plus, when using this setting FreeSync becomes disabled. Maybe there's a way to run both but I haven't figured it out.

Lastly, not all mounts will fit this monitor due to the very large bump just under the mounting area. I assume the bump is where the psu is located, which is my other complaint. Heat dissipation is very poor and I've noticed a fair amount of heat coming off the monitor, likely because of the PSU being built into it rather than being a separate brick like most monitors.

All that to say, I may return it for the ASUS VG34VQL1B or Gigabyte G34WQC.

Update: Returned, ghosting and smearing was just too bad in HDR even when doing non gaming stuff.",0,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

Reading about the differences I was expecting the picture on my new Dell to be a bit of a downgrade on how the colors would pop. I was willing to make this tradeoff for more screen real estate. However while there is a difference in the two monitors, as to be expected between any monitors, the color issue is nonexistent. This monitor, hooked through the display port, running at 144 HZ, on a 1660 super card is simply brilliant.

I did a lot of youtube research before deciding on what model to buy and this one kept coming up as the best in it's class as a VA screen. The next possible option was to go IPS and spend another $300-350. I'm glad I decided to save a bit of cash and go with this Dell.

It's bright, clear, with no dead or bright pixels. Sitting in front of the screen there is no fade as one looks to the edges. Also for a VA screen one can go quite a ways side to side before noting any fade in the picture. To me that is a nonissue anyway as I'm always at the desk if using the computer.

I was going to install it on my moveable arm but, the stand is so nice, and the monitor so big that I decided not to do that. Instead I used the included stand and it works great. My adjustable arm and old 27"" were moved together to my old standby computer and are doing quite well there.

The only issue I had was registering it at Dell. When I clicked on the link at their site to register it would only take me to their diagnostic tool that would determine what product I had. Here's where the trouble started as it would only scan my pc, not a Dell, and say my computer couldn't be registered. Duh, it's not a Dell. So to register it to my Dell account I had to call Dell support and talk to a tech who completed the registration for me.

I've had it now for almost three weeks and couldn't be happier with my choice.",18,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

I bought this to use for work from home, and for recording (Reaper). It was to replace a pair of 27"" Acer CB2's (IPS). The extra horizontal pixel real estate is great, as is the curve, which is really easy to get used to. The extra width makes displaying two windows side by side really intuitive and really cuts down on needing to resize or scroll either horizontally. I'm totally sold on this size, resolution and the curve. It took me about 5 minutes to realize there's no going back - though this particular monitor went back, more on that in a minute.

While I love the size and format, this monitor was initially a bit of a let down for my intended use. The VA panel is much more washed out and inconsistent off axis, and it's quite noticeable next to an IPS panel. Note- understanding this is the nature of the panel technology, and that curved IPS monitors are currently offered at a much higher price point, I'm not deducting stars for this. I just feel it's important to point out for anyone else considering replacing an existing IPS 16:9 monitor with this. If you're not going to use it SxS with an IPS monitor, this might not be as big of an issue for you. It gets plenty bright and the contrast and sharpness are good enough for office use.

The first thing that did cost a star was VESA mounting. If you intend to mount it a VESA mount, the depth of the mounting plate makes this exceptionally difficult. It's recessed deeper than any monitor I've ever seen. It appears this is purely for aesthetic reasons to make the stock stand integrate into the weird super deep ribbed design of the back of the monitor. The mounts I have are made by Humanscale with a quick release plate which won't work with this deep mounting design. I had to attach the whole arm with the plate attached, then fit it to the post/clamp assembly. Mind you this is a big heavy monitor, so it's quite difficult to do. If the arms of my monitor didn't separate from the desk clamp easily, this would have been a two-person job.

Another star was lost with the menu and controls. The multiple buttons and joy stick thingy on the back right edge just plain suck. While you can assign functions to the individual buttons, I could never seem to hit the right one for it to be useful at all. It's just a bunch of buttons on the back of the monitor that I can't see. One or two buttons and a joystick might work, but any more than three is madness. I would nearly always hit the wrong button causing it to switch to an input other than what I wanted or on which there was no signal- which means you have to wait for it to register this before you can correct your mistake, which is just exasperating. Also the the edge location of the controls means that if you have a multi monitor setup, you can't get to the controls that abut another monitor on that edge without swiveling one of the monitors- and note that the supplied stand doesn't swivel. Many LG monitors have a single joy stick control on the bottom center of the monitor which is way more useful for multi-monitor setup.

The remaining stars were lost due was an annoying issue with the supplied HDMI cable (: It kept blanking periodically for 5-10 seconds. I tried several quality certified cables and still experienced the issue- with both an HP Elitebook and a Lenovo T470 (both in docking stations). I also had issues with the Display Port too: Coming out of hibernate, I had to power cycle the monitor and mess with Display Properties in Windows 10 to get it to work - EVERY time. The final straw which caused me to pack it up and return it was a 3/8"" streak of bad / burned pixels in the center of the screen.

I ended up sending it back and bought a pair of 35"" LG 35WN65C-B's, which I'm much happier with. They're also VA panels, but the colors seem a little less muted, and the off-axis presentation is a little more even. The mounting point is much shallower and works with my mounts, the picture is warmer, and the inputs are much easier to access; For the life of me, I don't understand why monitor manufacturers think it's good product design to hide the inputs upside-down where they're completely invisible with the monitor in normal upright orientation, and only providing tiny embossed black on black labels which you simply cannot read without a bright flashlight. The LG's are straight in on the back, about half way up, where you can see the orientation and location of the port (even if the labels are still nearly invisible). The external DC power brick also means a lighter monitor on the arm and easier, cleaner cable routing from the monitor to the back of the desk.",25,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

I won't name the manufacturer because the monitor was very good and I enjoyed the sharp text, etc., and I chalked most of the ""going south"" to our power grid. I retrieved my 27"" ooolder (not a misspelling) monitor and used that monitor for 5-6 months. I finally decided that my old eyes deserved something better so I started looking for monitors

From previous research I know that by and large Dell monitors are very good. I settled on this monitor and am not sorry at all. The text is very very sharp, photos (that I've worked on - graphic designer) are very true to the original and in a couple of cases better and that's without any calibration. I'm not a gamer and this monitor is probably wasted on me but . . . . . . I did give it 5 stars for gaming and as stated, I'm not a gamer so take that into consideration.

I kind of wanted a curved monitor (reason totally unknown except I thought they looked cool) and am not disappointed. I have to admit I think the ""curved"" monitor is a little over rated but then again I'm using it 95% for graphic design work. Recommend? Yes.",6,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3222HG

It has a 21:9 aspect ratio and a 178° viewing angle, which means you can see every detail. With a WQHD curved monitor screen that provides a resolution of 3440 x 1440 on a 34-inch panel, you'll get exceptional clarity that will take your gaming experience to the next level. For the work, at first using an HDMI with my MacBook Air was a disaster as it showing the content blurry and distorted. However, once I connected the monitor through the DPI port, it was amazing. Extremely clear!

This monitor has a 144Hz refresh rate, so you'll be able to see fast-moving visuals with impressive clarity, allowing for faster reaction times. It also has AMD FreeSync premium technology, which means you'll be able to stay engaged during battle with swift, responsive, stutter-free gameplay. The tilt and rise options provides many combination of height and angle adjustment giving you maximum comfort, even during extended periods. I particularly loved that it literally took my 5 minutes to hook up. Unlike many other monitors, there were no tools required and the entire stand setup took less than 30 seconds! This is an amaizng feat and I can't thank Dell enough for thinking about the user friendliness of this design.

Overall, this 1800R curved gaming monitor is an excellent choice for gamers who want an immersive and high-performing monitor. Whether you're an esports competitor or a casual gamer, this monitor can keep up with you, so don't hesitate to add it to your gaming setup or work setup or both!",8,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

pros
- pretty good image quality for it only being 1080p on a 27 inch. obliviously if you are big into having this crisp clear image you give some of that up for the size so make note if you want to be able to see tiny details to invest in something with a higher quality. but it gets the job done and still looks pretty good.
- the size is something to get adjusted to if upgrading from a smaller monitor. the curve adds to your overall gameplay. i found it to be more immersive and give me a different feel to the games i already play.
- the color is good and gives you many options. a lot of the monitor can be adjusted in its settings so any issues you find can already be fixed on your own.
-you can easily adjust the height of this. sometimes it can be a bit hard if you want to do a small adjustment but that doesn’t bother me.
-no dead pixels or any screen ghosting. i’ve had this monitor left on the same image for hours and have seen no burn in. as well as no random dead pixels anywhere.
- very smooth. even just scrolling on any random website looks smooth so with games it makes it feel like you got a new pc too.
cons
-a lot of the darker tones can be washed out. after messing with the color settings for a while i still haven’t found the perfect mix of brightness that doesn’t sacrifice any darker colors. it doesn’t bother me that much but note that if you want a bright screen know you sacrifice a lot of the darker tones for that.
-any smaller words such as typing a paper or any reading is sometimes difficult to see. i wouldn’t recommend this for someone looking to do work for long hours. this is alright if you want to do mainly gaming and occasionally maybe homework but if you need to read small text just stick to working on a laptop.
-the monitor doesn’t turn off on its own. (this is more of a personal thing but i wish there was a setting where if there was no input that the monitor could automatically turn off.
- can’t really angle it up or down. you can slightly put it at an angle but you can only really move it up and down.
- i figured this is a given since it’s a monitor but it doesn’t include speakers. you’ll have to buy your own speakers if you want to do anything without headphones on.
overall this monitor gives out more than the price point it’s put at. if you’re looking for an affordable monitor that still offers a good/smooth look and size go with this.",5,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2721HGF

Obviously you can play competitive shooters on it like I do, but sometimes you can notice some smearing in dark on bright settings.

Set to 80% brightness, the second-fastest response time, and freesync enabled, this monitor is simply fantastic. Controls are intuitive, it gets very bright, and the picture is simply lovely. Especially for singleplayer games. You really get immersed

Obviously this monitor is BIG. Dimensionally the panel is about 32"" wide, 15"" tall, and the stand takes up about 11"" of desk space. It is height and tilt adjustable, both pitch and roll

It's a great buy for 450$, what I paid for it, but i've seen sales for this monitor as low as 380$. For that price, it's a fabulous deal and a purchase you wouldn't regret

The S3222HG is very nice. The curved screen is more marketing but STILL offers slight enhancement advantage as long as your head is at the ""focus"" of the curve.
As a secondary display AND my PC on the left side of the 42"" and the Dell being on the right side, the 6 foot cord is inadequate. I need at LEAST 10"" more. I'll need to get a 10 foot to get the cord off my desk. One other small nitpick is the stand is ""so-so"". My old 24"" Dell stand is excellent. It has a more stable footprint and it is able to swivel and raise and lower. The S3222HG stand can not swivel. I plan on 3D printing an adapter piece so I can use the old stand.

Otherwise I am happy with the display for the price. Paying the little extra for 165Hz, mostly for infrequent gaming, is a nice enhancement.",3,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3222HG

It was my first VA panel so I don't know if all VA panels have this issue or is it more pronounced with this model. I for one will NOT be picking up any VA monitor after this.
In 'game presets' the MOBA/RTS preset was the only one that made a slight difference, but only just.

It includes its cable of current and an hdmi. I use it to play with a laptop with an RTX 2060 and it takes advantage of GSync and 144hz perfectly (to use GSync you need to use a display port cable, so you have to buy one separately since the monitor only includes an hdmi cable , to use Freesync you can use hdmi or dp). the monitor is very good, it does not produce heat and it is held very well and it has a support that allows you to adjust the monitor to your liking except turning it. a small observation is that the base being vertically movable you must apply pressure on the monitor, the base is a bit hard so you have to lower or raise it carefully since you can damage the monitor if you apply a lot of force (I recommend that you use your two hands to move it and holding it directly from the center at the bottom where the logo is and the top so you don't have problems and complications when moving it) on the base it holds very well and won't move unless you do. It is very comfortable, good and small frames on the screen, it is not very thick, it is very good and Perfect. One detail is only that in the shipment, as it is not packed in a box and as it is sent directly in its original packaging, it is very damaged, but in the same way it is only the box and inside it is very well protected.

I thought the Ultrawide would allow me to work more effectively .... however, it's much smaller than to old TV. I used to be able to work without my readers. The type face on this is so small, I need to wear readers. If I expand the font, then the lack of space become apparent.

It appears to be a nice piece of equipment, but the simple fact is that did not know what I was buying in to.

The only issue, this is an ultra0wide and very modern. I work from home and use my company's Dell laptop. The driver loaded is for generic monitors and it does not recognize the wide aspect.

BUT when I plugged it in via HDMI from my Lenovo Thinkpad the resolution was unbearable. This is the same problem with any UWS HD monitor especially if you are using it for work (which I am). I searched countless articles and videos on how to resolve and nothing worked but I figured out the solution so I'm saving others my pain. First my laptop is corp issued, under powered and locked down to the point that I can't download .exe drivers. To fix the problem I bought a Startech.com Display port adaptor which has a small GPU installed in it to increase the resolution (about $100 on Amazon). Out of the box the Startech solved the problem but I did have to install the Display port driver from Displayport.com, and thankfully display port offers 3 different formats for the driver including .MSI which bypassed my .exe block on my corp computer. The monitor works perfectly and is totally game changing. So if you are stuck trying to drive it with an old or underpowered laptop get yourself the adaptor - was literally plug and play out of the box with the driver install and the monitor is perfect.",6,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

Jacoby,4.0,2022-08-02 00:00:00,美國,,"First - the good news:

Got this monitor on Prime Day after a LOT of research - reviews here, through online articles (PC Mag, CNET, etc.), and watching YouTube videos. I use it for work (business analyst) and in a graphic design capacity (hobbies). It's basically like having two monitors in one and the color, clarity, response time, and flexibility of the display was a huge upgrade from what I had been tolerating (Westinghouse 32"" TV).

The bad news is I'm taking away a star b/c somewhere along the line, I was led to believe this monitor had speakers AND the menus and setup kind of lead you down that path as well. Sorry folks - no speakers on this monitor :(.

Since the listing never mentions sound or speakers, I take full blame for making that assumption. HOWEVER - the monitor was automatically recognized by my laptop as an audio output device, was made the default audio device, AND the monitor has audio controls on its menu. So for a minute there, I was SUPER stoked! Alas, after a quick chat with Dell customer care, they confirmed that the monitor is speakerless...

Overall, this is a GREAT monitor. Not much of a gamer but the ultra-wide format and the extra few inches made it seem like I was adding two monitors to my workspace instead of one. Plus, the extra screen real-estate in full-screen mode significantly reduced the need for scrolling in spreadsheets and design software.",10,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

It is in great shape, minus 2 screws loose on the inside rolling around making a hck of a noise. I removed those by popping the back panel off on one side to ensure the screen didn't self destruct someday.

This is definitely due to the previous owner tampering with it and forgetting to reinsert all of the screws....I feel if Amazon took care of their workers more, things like this wouldn't slip by so much.

So this this monitor might have the best VA panel I've ever seen. I game a considerable amount and I can honestly say this is a great gaming monitor! The black smearing which VA panels are notorious for are almost non-existent and I say almost only because I was intentionally looking for them! The response time is spot on, so much so that I don't notice it. The curve is perfect for immersion and if you are coming from a flat panel after a few hours you may not be able to go back to flat panels. The menu controls are exceptionally easy to navigate, the stand is sturdy, and the overall build quality feels very premium. Truthfully I can't say enough good things about this monitor!
Cons:
While there isn't much negative to say, nothing is perfect. There is a small amount of backlight bleed, but I only notice when I put a black screen on! Honestly if I had not done that I would never notice it. The stand is only tilt and height adjust, but I knew that when I bought it and personally I have no need for swivel and rotation.
Other Thoughts:
My previous two monitors had been a 144hz 1440p flat panel and early 35 inch 2560x1080 curved ultrawide and I don't miss either one of those. I could have easily gotten a 1440p curved display but with gpu prices going crazy with no end in sight and wanting to run game at a high refresh rate with high details I opted for 1080p (which still looks amazing even on a 27 inch display). I have zero buyer's remorse and hope this review helps anyone on the fence in regards to this particular monitor. Also g-sync worked right out of the box and I only needed to make some very minor adjustments to get the picture I wanted.",4,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2721HGF

Those looking for G-sync can enable it in the Nvidia control panel but be warned that with this panel you may experience flickering on games (most notably with Apex legends). I have gotten used to it, but the device isn't certified to work with G-sync, but for most games it is fine.

Overall, Dell has done a fine job supporting me with problems on this monitor and the monitor itself can be a great introduction into the ultrawide landscape.

I have this hooked up to my 3080 and am lucky enough to experience most games at 144Hz at this resolution; recently Halo Infinite has been a blast and games like Microsoft Flight simulator are a wonderful experience, second only to VR.

The monitor is a VA panel, so expect common problems with it - but since it is curved it still does a much better job in viewing angles compared to most TNs on the market.

The monitor is light, relatively speaking, for a 34 inch ultrawide with these features as I am able to use my VESA monitor stand at the end of my desk. The included stand is fine with it being height and angled adjustable - but a monitor stand with VESA should be the way to go.",1,顯示尺寸: 34 Inches樣式: S3422DWG

It took me a while to realize that this monitor's response time just isn't good and doesn't work well with Freesync. So, I enabled MPRT for the response time, which automatically disabled Freesync (as it should), and all those above problems went away. With my current GPU I get 85-100fps running with the 144Hz refresh rate, and don't experience any screen tearing at all, and with MPRT enabled it's a very smooth experience. I'd expect with my upgraded GPU (on order) that I'll get near 144fps to match the refresh rate and it will improve all that much more.

Pros:
- it's not a weird widescreen resolution, so websites don't get stretched oddly
- the stand allows for a lot of control on height and tilt, right out of the box.
- Really good clarity and color balance without much adjustment
- a simple cable management hole in the stand made all the difference in keeping my desk neat with a wired keyboard + webcam. Really a nice touch.

Cons
- It is VERY heavy once set up. It can be difficult to adjust on a desk because of that. If you have noodle arms like me, a second person might be helpful to have around if you need to pick it up and move it off the floor.",11,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: S3222HG

After some investigating I found a fix and it is:

1. Purchase an upgraded VESA certified display port 1.4 cable. It seems not all display port 1.4 cables are created equal and since 1440p at 144 hz is near the cables maximum bandwidth, any deviation in quality can result in poor performance and cause flickering.

2. Don't install the drivers supplied by Dell for the monitor, for some reason they mess things up. Instead, just install your AMD video card drivers and the Radeon control center. Also, use the Windows Generic PnP monitor driver that's enabled by default. I think doing so disables HDR, but it's a small price to pay in my opinion.

Of course, being a VA display its still susceptible to flickering on game menus, loading screens and when framerates drop really low (like 60-70 fps). I also notice flickering on any game that caps the framerate at 60 fps and doesn't let you change it (such as Sim City). But the vast majority of gameplay is flawless (for instance Call of Duty Coldwar with framerates constantly adjusting between 115 - 135 fps). And if you do encounter a game that has lots of flickering (which is unlikely with first person shooters and any other games optimized for high end graphics cards) you can easily disable FreeSync through the Radeon Control center at the touch of a button.

It plays games really well and has great color/saturation/brightness/etc. HOWEVER, I have some complaints.
I ordered this monitor to replace an older Spectre one that was starting to get lines at the bottom.
When I ordered it the first time I plugged it in and it looked great. Played some games and had fun with it. My PC fell asleep while I was afk and when I came back to wake it up, boom, the dreaded lines and a dead pixel popped up. This was the SAME DAY I had just gotten it.
So I changed the DP cable to see if it was that and nope, it was in fact the monitor.
I ordered a replacement and it arrived the next day. I'm currently using this new replacement monitor and when I took it out of the box I had a few more issues.
I ordered a new DP cable just in case and swapped it out beforehand. When I loaded up a game it started showing a bit of back flashing so I researched and finally saw it could be the NIVIDIA G-Sync. Turned that off and boom no more back flickering. Also would recommend turning down the sharpness as it can make some text look a bit pixeled.

All in all its a great monitor for the price and looks awesome for games. If you're using it for 144hz make sure to have a Display Port cable or it will not get the max framerate. Also if you have some back flickering try turning off your NIVIDIA G-Sync. If you're willing to deal with a bit of issues its worth buying.",0,顯示尺寸: 27 Inches樣式: S2721HGF

This QHD 2.5K monitor at no scaling matches the pixel density of the scaled UHD. The gentle curve of this monitor removes the need for too much angling of the flat panels and keeps everything in sharp focus in all areas of the screen. I do complex software development and so need the real estate of dual monitors. Text is clear throughout.

One drawback with these when used as dual monitors though. While the power button is still below the panel like on the UHD versions, the monitor settings buttons are on the back of the panel.

Dell KM5221W Pro Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo
I bought to replace a similar Logitech keyboard/mouse combo that inexplicably stopped working correctly with my work issued Dell laptop after some Windows 10 updates which wouldn't work right no matter what I tried to do to remedy the issues. I had hoped that by installing the DELL hardware combo, I would get better results and fewer bugs using it with W10. In this regard, it does work and I am not constantly dealing with weird interoperability issues anymore.
But I have to say, that the design, ergonomics, and just overall ""feel"" this Dell set is not nearly as nice or as comfortable to type with compared to the Logitech variety. The Dell keyboard is very plain, small and the keys aren't contoured, they're just flat. The function keys are 1/2 size of normal keys. The set is a bit disappointing and basic, especially given it cost approximately $20 more than my similar Logitech version. Overall, I am underwhelmed with the Dell set, but at least now I have a working non-buggy set!",9,

This keyboard matches other Dell keyboards in terms of layout, which was my goal. But one thing I didn't notice until I bought it and started using it is the F-Keys are different. On this keyboard the F-Keys require use of the fn key. I use F-Keys quite a bit in my work and therefore I'm going to search out a different unit to use. This won't affect most folks though - but might be a consideration if you're an IT pro or otherwise use the F-Keys a lot.

The keyboard has a nice typing feel to it - it does not take a lot of effort to type and types with ease accurately. However, the mouse is so poorly designed - it is a round, fat mouse, and difficult to hold and use. I have a logitech mouse that has rubber sides for easy gripping, and a curved middle to fit nicely in your hand. This mouse is the cheapest mouse I have ever owned.

Even though I used this keyboard with a different mouse (logitech), I still decided to return this keyboard because the labels that are on the keys are faint and cannot be seen easily. The worst are the function keys which I use all the time with my applications. You simply cannot see the function keys' labels, which they made fainter than the labels on the other keys. The keys themselves, are shiny, causing the faint ""Fx"" symbols, which are tiny and faint, to be nearly invisible. The ceiling light in the room makes the keys even more difficult to read. Because the function keys are smaller than a full-sized keyboard, I can't rely on memory for where the function keys are placed; I would keep missing the keys and hit the wrong function key because of the size of these function keys. I would therefore have to stop typing and look closely at the function keys to make sure I pressed the correct ones.

I can also tell that the labels on the regular keys are not going to last long. The ""F"" and ""J"" keys are already starting to get that very over-used/old shiny look and starting to wear out.

While it's nice that this keyboard is wireless, it is not worth the price and inconvenient function key usage, and glossy looking keys whose labels won't last long.

Got a wired Macally keyboard instead. SX scissor keys are the ones that feel most comfortable for me (not straining my fingers).",2,

At the time of purchase, I had looked at multiple options for keyboard/mouse combos and landed on this one. There were a few reviews at the time that caught my attention, ""keys stick,"" ""mouse issues,"" etc but at the time I assumed they were one-offs. This product being a Dell, from Dell was enough for me to take a chance. I wish I had not.
I'll start off by saying this combo is being used in an office setting during a normal M-F 9 to 5. There is no excessive wear and tear. Almost immediately, I started receiving a ""mouse battery low"" error, that is lovely enough to be shown as a pop up window that won't time out. You have to manually clear it from your display every time. This error came within the first two weeks of use. At first I thought, no problem, the batteries that shipped with them wasn't name brand, may have just been bad batteries. So I changed them to Duracell Pros. I still continually get this error daily even with the first set of new batteries and an additional set. Plus the pop up is annoying to have to clear multiple times throughout the day. Second issues with the mouse is that it looses its mind at least three of the five working days. It jumps from one portion of the screen to the other, 'double clicks' when I only click once so every email I click on opens up or pages/items move when I don't want them to, etc. Overall, bad mouse.
The keyboard does not fair better. The keys do stick. Badly. Again, this started happening early into the purchase, probably a month. It's annoying as well especially when its the function keys or Enter, then all kinds of background tasks are trying to open and I can't do anything except for turn the keyboard off and rake the keys trying to unstick the one that's stuck.
With the issues between the two devices this combo is definitely a distraction and not in a good way.",4,

On the other hand, the mouse is garbage. While it ""works,"" I find that the buttons have nowhere near enough resistance so I'm constantly accidentally clicking when I'm simply resting my fingers on the buttons. I'll be returning this set and buying something else that works better for me.

A couple other things to note: this set does not come with rechargeable batteries, so get ready to regularly replace the batteries. It is also not bluetooth-enabled so you'll need to use the USB-A dongle, which is a pain if your laptop only has USB-C ports, which will require an adapter (not included).",1,

SECOND UPDATE ~ Down to a 1-star review now. Another month of using this keyboard and it has another problem. Keys randomly stick and continue typing dozens of the same character until I hit the Esc key. It's not just one or two keys. It happens with multiple number and letter keys. If I still had the packaging I would return this in a heartbeat. It's horrible.

UPDATE ~ I've had this keyboard for 9 days and for the first 5 days things were wonderful (see my original review statements below). However, the keyboard is now lagging/skipping characters. I'm also experiencing issues with my mouse and keyboard not working after my computer comes out of sleep mode or I've been inactive for 5-10 minutes and the computer hasn't even entered sleep mode. I have to remove the USB doggle and plug it back in to get them to work. Very frustrating. I can no longer recommend this product.

I replaced the batteries 5 different times thinking that was the problem and that would help for a day and then back to not working at all. When I logged in to my account to return the product I had missed the return timeframe by 2 days. I ordered this product on Nov 17 and by the first week of February it completely stopped working altogether. Now I’m just out the money for a keyboard that never really worked correctly the 2 months I had it.,1,

Came well packaged and I got it up and running without much hassle.

The PC itself runs well and has decent specs. The small form factor is a pro and con since, while it has a PCIe port to potentially connect a low profile graphics card for those budget gamers, the slot is right next to the PSU so your options are:
1. Get a riser cable and put the GPU somewhere else, since there's not much space inside.
2. Get a single slot GPU, but it will be right against the PSU, it will most likely run hot since there will be minimal airflow.
3. Place the PSU out side and jank your way into placing the GPU in its place. (please don't do this)

For some reason, the PC rebooted when I connected headphones for the first time, and did it again each time I did it, until I used window's SFC to fix some files. I assume this was just a corrupt windows installation, since its hasn't happened again.

Now, the PC comes bundle with a mouse and keyboard and for those:
The keyboard couldn't be worse, the keys are hard to press and feel like your grinding plastic everything you press down.
The mouse was dead or arrival.
The little USB bluetooth/WiFi dongle does the job, but I don't expect it to be reliable.

This machine arrived and when I fired it up, the CPU fan made a horrible noise. Contacted seller and they gave me a few options to try to fix the CPU fan. Opened it up and found the heat sink hadn't been tightened down completely, but once that was done, the unit is quiet and very fast for the price. As for the unit itself, it arrived as described, was very clean inside. It looks new. It is fast to start up, runs fast once it is booted up too.

These corporate machines were designed with 5-8 year life spans and are easily to upgrade things like RAM, adding a video card, etc.

It is my primary work at home machine and has been on continuously since it came out of the box in July and it is mid December, not one issue, blue screen or problem. Handles everything I can throw at it like Office 365, web browsing, YouTube even at 4K, etc. I am not a gamer so I have no idea how well it would handle a modern game, but I imagine you would want to put a better video card for that purpose than rely on on board video.

These machines have plenty of life and are built to last. It keeps them out of the landfill and you get a much better box than some black Friday wonderbox at Best Buy filled with bloatware and bottom end hardware that will barely hold up past it's 1 year warranty.",11,顏色: Standard Desktop

So I shut it off and pulled the cover to see that there is a KimgFast SSD. I replaced it with a Samsung 870 EVO SSD, since KingFast is not on the approved list of SSD's. Put it back together and fired it up using a USB flash drive with Windows 10 Pro. During setup on the domain, the computer ran super slow. The two other refurbished PC's with the same exact specs from another refurbisher fired up on the domain immediately. I also noticed that the fan speed in the PC was running very high for over 15 minutes. But these computers are used for testing imaging software in the healthcare industry. Once it performed all of the driver updates including a firmware update , it ran a little bit better. One thing to note, it does not have a DVD-RW drive. I know that some refurbishers use the cheapest Hardware to get the biggest bang for their buck, but packing a PC poorly will only result in returns and a bad reputation.

I first noticed this when I dropped a charger plug near it and the screen flicked off for a split second. Got it through the start up process, and been having nothing but problems trying to keep the screen on. Not too happy with it at the moment. Restarted and the screen stayed on for all of 5 minutes past startup before flickering off. have run several updates (turn off, turn on, hit update with auto restart as quickly as possible, rinse repeat.) I'm hoping to get past this problem with updates or with the display port adapter I ordered hopefully arriving tomorrow. still a big issue that my wireless keyboard dongle won't function if the dongle is plugged into the rear of the computer, and if my Wifi adapter is plugged into a rear port it runs VERY inefficiently. front ports are the only reason I haven't smashed my keyboard on the ground typing this review. plenty of issues.

Its a laptop docking station that also charges my cell which is great, although many people seem to think its an expensive phone charger. It worked immediately with 3 different laptops and there's no ticking noises like others mentioned. I also didnt attempt to use the usb ports while the docking station is disconnected from the laptop, I dont have a use case for that. Its simple to hook up and it feels heavy/sturdy although its a small item, compared to docking stations I've used in the past.

I thought the Qi charging was a nice bonus to help reduce the number of chargers and cables at my desk as well.

Unfortunately, when used with my M1 Macbook air, after sleeping for 5-10 minutes with the laptop closed the USB ports are no longer functional and I have to unplug and reconnect the dock to my Mac for the USB ports to regain function (note, the charging and HDMI functions work fine while the USB ports do not). The dock seems to work fine if I leave the Macbook open 100% of the time, but most times I prefer to use the external monitor only. I've used several other docks and hubs with the same laptop and have not ran into this problem.

Another downside is the built-in USB-C host cable cannot be disconnected from the dock. I would like to have the dock on the left side of my monitor, with my laptop on the right. Unfortunately, the built-in cable cannot even reach from one side of a 24"" monitor to the other comfortably. Would have preferred a separate USB-C cable to connect the dock to my laptop.

Overall, some quirks when used with a Mac and some room for improvement.",2,

The dock has a wireless charging stand, four USB-A ports, one HDMI port, one DP port, one RJ45 port, and one USB-C port.

I’ve been using the dock for about a month, and I like it. The dock does have a larger footprint than a small hub, but I’ll take the bigger size in exchange for a wireless charger that works and reduced cord clutter. The bulky cables (power for the dock, HDMI) plug into the back, so I can put it at the edge of my desk and regain some space. Two of the USB-A ports are accessible on the right side.

I use the dock with my 2017 MacBook Pro and an external monitor. The refresh rate is 60Hz. The dock powers my laptop and charges the battery when needed. The dock gets warm while using it, but not scary hot.

I use the wireless charging stand for my phone and headphones, it’s probably the best wireless charger I’ve tried. It just works -- I never have to fiddle with positioning. I have a Note 20 Ultra and the camera bump can make finding the proper positioning difficult. Not so with this stand. I just stick my phone on the stand and it charges. I use a thin TPU case, but have tried thicker Casetify cases and they work.

There is a tiny white LED light under the edge of the stand, it turns on when a device is being charged. The angle is perfect so the light isn’t in your eyes while working on the computer, but easily visible to check charging status.

I really wish the dock had a power button. The power cable for the dock has a bright blue LED light, so I see it whenever I walk by my desk and in the middle of the night. I like to turn off some electronics when I’m not using them, so I have to physically unplug this one from the power strip. There is a power button but it only works with Dell laptops, it has some function with them.",2,

I am pretty like that idea since I can charge my phone and use it as a stand as well for my phone.
On the back, it will have 1 display port and 1 HDMI port which can support for 2 4k Display and both can be at 60Hz. But that would be the maximum it could go. I wish it could be both display ports not HDMI. The USB C on the side was just for the charging or reading the data not able to connect to the 3rd monitor. I have not try with Daisy chain for 3rd monitor and I will try it soon with my new set up complete.
It is just plug and play and no drivers require for Dell Laptop. However, each of Dell Dock will have the service tag. I would highly recommend to get the tag and go to support Dell page then download all of the current firmware and driver then up to date for a better performance.
There is also a Power button to turn on your PC instead of opening the LID then press the power on the laptop.
If it can equip the SD and microSD card reader then it will be fantastic. However, I never seen one on Dell Dock.
For the price, it is pretty decent price to run dual 4k monitors. Overall, it is working as it should.",0,

If you want to connect to a wall outlet, you must deal with an (included) power adapter.

If this fits your Dell device(s), your space and logistics, the docking station itself is sturdy, good-looking and concise.

Using the 3-prong plug power cord: Definitely take into consideration that there is a 3 foot long, thick and unwieldy black cord that connects the hefty power adapter (not shown anywhere in these pictures on the product page) to a wall outlet with a 3-prong plug. The power adapter is 6.25"" x 3"" x 1"". On the other end of the adapter there is a permanently attached thick and unwieldy 6.5 foot black cord that connects to the docking station. That is a lot of cord and a bulky adapter! Maybe you need that length, and good for you. But I don't have room for all that unsightly cord.

For powered devices: You can use your own cables (none provided) to connect to the back of the docking station, and you won't need the power adapter.

Then there is a permanently attached USB C cable coming from the docking station and it goes to your laptop.

Also be aware: This is not compatible with Dell AIOs.",2,

Impressive desktop cell phone/device charger and hub. Beautifully designed, built and thoughtfully engineered to reduce clutter. It may be the only Phone charger/Device HUB you need. Dell’s Dual charge dock provides up to 90 watts of power delivery, takes up just a bit more surface area than a deck of playing cards and features 9 standard ports for interconnecting your components. In addition, it’s built in Qi-enabled can charge your earbuds or smartphone on its charging stand. The stand itself is sturdy at more than 23 ounces so when working as a hub it sits firmly on your desk.

It should be noted that this charging/hub has the USB C in 2 formats. On one side of the charger is the standard USB C connector and for convivence there is also a permanently attached USB C cable affixed to the rear. It is about 3 foot in length allowing you to bring any USB C powered device over to the hub and charge with the built-in charging cable. Very practical. Here is a charger that you can use that you do not need to first find a cable to use it.

Pros:
• The hub features: 4 X USB Type A, 1 USB Type C, HDMI 2.1 Port, USB-C 3.2, DisplayPort 1.4, RJ45 (Ethernet)
• This unit will support MAC address pass through. Video Resolution: (Dual Displays) 8K -30HZ or (Single Display) 4K -60HZ.
• Watching a movie...? This unit will charge your phones battery in a vertical or horizontal position.
Cons:

• Fully utilized this small hub could be charging your phone while supporting dual Monitors with your laptop while sharing the internet and powering other peripherals. That is allot of cables. But that is both the downside and the beauty of this as a hub. Just how neatly the Dell Dock keeps connections tidy and organized.

Products are flawed, people are desperately selling anything, and the quality graph line is dropping on everything. With that said let's dig deeper.

I knew ordering this during a monsoon season here in CA was on me, and the usual great Dell box was wet and not looking typically awesome. I have an older rare Dell white IPS 32inch monitor, and was $150 a few years ago. Classy looking monitor. It even auto switched activated devices. Cables could easily be pulled and changed in a second or two, and no bells and whistles. The controls are a Rubiq's Qube to navigate though.

This Dell, like my Samsung 4k 32inch monitor, are nightmares when trying to change HDMI, DP, and other wires. Who is designing computers, monitors, and labeling things, BLIND PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. OMG. Why does everything require a flashlight, headlamp, mirrors, 3000 lumen beams, while holding all these things precariouly leaning over the equipment, and desperately trying to shove the stuff in a dark slot before falling over on it? I defy anyone to perform cable installation or changing before the calendar year flips. I do not think I'm alone in my complaint here.

A few good things, price dropped like a rock to $350 with $100 off(why? Stay tuned), picture is high quality with no adjustments out of the box mentioned by others, speaker output is perfectly placed and easy to plug in and out, USBs are fairly accessible on the bottom with some fiddling, on off button is lighted and easy to activate, base is heavy and make the monitor feel somewhat stable and firm, and not nearly as wobbly as my Samsung 32inch. Nice thing about this 2560x1440 Dell, the Windows 11 fonts, sizing, and graphics are much easier to read than my Samsung 4k tiny print. Windows XP AND 7 were a dream for having one place to change how everything looked or made readable. Windows is dumber, less fun, and more complicated, as cell phones become smarter and wiser.

LASTLY, here's why, IMHO, that the price dropped by $100. This Dell, unlike some others I've owned, does not allow you to adjust the monitor's physical leveling. The monitor only moves horizontally and vertcally, but not from landscape to portrait mode. Why is this important, the monitor is about an 1/8th to 1/4 of an inch off from being level!! Have never seen this. You cannot adjust it to level. After much contemplation, loosening screws and retightening, shimming, NOTHING WORKED, and I'm am very good at fixing stuff. How did I fix it? I put one taller base foot temporarily on the right side to mitigate the drooping on that side. Sanding down the rubber feet on the left may work too. OK, on to other problems. I decided to keep it and not return it. Your welcome Amazon. Still a good deal for $350.",22,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: G3223D

You'll get the typical pros and cons of an IPS panel with two notable exceptions:

Pro: It has really great response time for IPS.
Con: The color temp is skewing yellow out of the box (lower the ""Gain"" for red (R) and green (G) in the monitor's menu by 5-10% each to correct for this)

Another thing of note is the box it ships in is well designed (has long has nothing sharp breaks thru the bottom). My box came with a rather large hole at the top but luckily the monitor was far enough away not to get damaged. The screen is supported by a strong cardboard frame and to assemble, you just leave the monitor in the box and clip on the stand (very easy to set up).

After tweaking the yellow tint away has explained earlier, you'll have an excellent well built display, just be sure you know what you're getting into with IPS panels, they excel more at brightly lit environments where color accuracy is important.

Games look colorful, sharp, and just AMAZING! Given the quality of the screen and features, this monitor is an amazing deal.

Pros:
-Colorful IPS screen. Colors look vibrant and whites look great!
-1440p (What I was looking for to allow high framerates on my Nvidia RTX 3080).
-Fast! 165hz, 1ms. No ghosting on the extreme setting. Very nice!
-32"" big screen
-Bright!
-USB-C connectivity for laptops, consoles, etc.

Cons
-HDR 400. I tested this, and it's not good. At this price-point, you have to expect this. After testing the HDR, I just ended up turning it off.

NOTE: The monitor has 2 USB-A ports to plug in peripherals. These only work if a computer is plugged into it via the USB-C port. I wanted to use these to plug in a drawing tablet and USB headphones for my PC. I found out that the only way to make this work is to plug in a long USB-C to USB-A 3.1 gen 2 cable. I plugged the USB-C end of the cable into the USB-C port on the monitor and the USB-A end into the back of my PC. I got an annoying USB message from Windows, but ignored it. All USB devices, included hard drives, now work great plugged into the monitor.

Number 3 is that this monitor is pretty sharp idk the pixels per inch but on the 32 inch its great, I have to put my face within like 6 to 7 inches to see a pixel so for the most part it looks sharp and smooth. the 1440p is the only drawback i can think of cause it looks great, I have tried 4k and 1080p for long periods of time and i gotta say its just like everyone says its a great middle ground and you will notice a bit of an upgrade. Only thing is this sacrifices like 10-15 fps on my 2060 which I dont really care too much but when im running cod maxish settings dlss set to balanced and im only getting 60 I had to adjust my settings but its fine i like it looking sharper then the graphics looking cleaner but just a word of warning for those on lower end (tbh I'm on a 115w 2060 so keep that in mind). another thing to keep in mind set the speed of the monitor refresh rate to the second option i it was called super fast, It has no draw backs and from reviews ive watched online makes the image pretty much have no ghosting and makes the response time around 2.2ish milliseconds but remember don't do the third as you will get overshoot and dont do the first as its a has a little bit of a trail to it (couldn't even notice the slight trails before but the millisecond difference between the first mode and super fast is immediately noticeable). Another thing this monitor deserves praise on is the buttons thank god they use a joystick in the back cause before when you had to memorize what every button did was a nightmare. Well thats about it, the monitor is great its also freaking massive I don't think it registered in my brain how big 32 inchs is cause I thought well thats only a 5 inch difference from my old one so thats another thing you should know but if you do end up buying it you wont regret it.",3,顯示尺寸: 32 Inches樣式: G3223D

It’s a well-designed monitor with a bright, crisp display that’s going to be really tough to beat without spending significantly more money. And, even if you do decide to spend significantly more money for a better monitor, the difference in picture quality isn’t going to wow you.

Now, with all that said, once you get this monitor up and running, you will definitely need to make several adjustments to it to get it dialed in exactly the way you like it. So, plan on spending about 45 minutes or so changing settings, making adjustments and fine tuning the picture. And, once you do that, I can’t imagine anyone being anything but happy with this monitor.

However, if I *had* to complain about something, it would be about the onboard speakers. There are none. And even though onboard speakers are generally pretty awful, I do still like having them as a listening option for office settings where good-sounding external speakers aren’t necessary.

Other than the minor speaker thing, I really couldn’t be more happy with this monitor. I think it’s a very solid choice if you’re looking for a 24” budget-friendly gaming monitor.

CONS:
So far I've only been able to identify two cons and the device is wonderful. If both of these were fixed in the future with Display Link software updates it would be an instant 5-star review.

FPS issues - I have three monitors of two different brands. My primary monitor which I use for gaming supports 240 FPS but is capped at 30 FPS with no options besides downgrading the FPS. My side monitors support 120 FPS, and although they are the same model and plugged in in the same manner one allows me to select 120 FPS while the other has no options for changing frames.

Wake Screen - This is a heartbreaker. I typically keep my MacBook docked vertically in clamshell mode in order to provide the best possible cooling at all times, but I have found out that whether I use a keyboard plugged into the device itself or into the D6000 I no longer have the ability to wake well the MacBook is in clamshell mode. If I hold down keys I will get a flicker as if it unlocks but after a few seconds, the screens revert to blank. At the moment this is solved by opening the MacBook from clamshell mode and then just shutting it right away. I have submitted a ticket for this instance and truly hope this is resolved. If you don't mind opening and closing your Macbook Pro once in a while this is by far the best option on the market for it all in one docking station.",11,樣式: 單件

Otherwise, this dock has been working great for me. I usually only use it to connect 1 monitor to my MacBook, but I have been able to use all 3 additional monitors. Finally, if you have to use adapters to convert between cable types make sure you are using an ACTIVE adapter, otherwise it will not work.

UPDATE: This review was originally written for OSX 10.14 (Mojave) and for the most part everything went smoothly. After upgrading to OSX 10.15.4 (Catalina) I ran into a few problems but still got everything to work. You can find the full instructions on their site but I'll summarize them here to hopefully save people some effort.

1. To get the Dock to work with Catalina you MUST upgrade to the latest device firmware. Unfortunately this can only be done from a Windows machine. Also pay close attention to the upgrade instructions, if you do not close all applications on your computer before starting the upgrade it may cause the upgrade to hang. Additionally I read that trying to do the upgrade via USB C causes issues. If your upgrade hangs, you can right click on the application icon and click close, this will start a rollback. Do not disconnect the power or USB until prompted to do so.

2. When installing the driver on your mac you must allow the system extension. This can be done through ""Security & Privacy"" and must be done within 30 minutes of attempting the install. See their site for more details. If you do not approve it within 30 minutes you can try installing it again to get the prompt again. To check if the extension has been denied you can check ""About This Mac > System Report"" and then check under ""Software > Disabled Software"" to make sure that the extension is not blocked. Additionally, under ""Software > Extensions"" you can scroll down until you see ""DisplayLinkDriver"" and verify that it says ""Yes"" under the ""Loaded"" column.

3. The last step is to allow the driver to record your screen in ""Security & Privacy"" settings.

Once again it's important to read all the instructions carefully otherwise you can run into issues like flickering screens, black screens, or just being unable to detect your monitors.

Hope that helps.",4,樣式: 單件

This is not an end user issue.

The product works well, but not if you want to drive 3 monitors from your workstation / laptop in a business environment where you'll be moving the laptop to meetings or home for the night and/or you have good habits / are required to lock your PC and timeout displays.

I will be returning this product and getting another D3100 and a second power adapter instead (as the 3100 doesn't chargeback).

TLDR:

I recently bought a MacBook Pro 15 and got a Dell D3100 dock to go with it ($120 or so, on Amazon). It worked amazingly well with one issue - no chargeback as that one is USB3.0. Getting tired of hauling my charger out of my bag... I got my boss to spring for this model that does 3 monitors as well and has chargeback.

I connected this device via the USB-C connector on the 'convertible' cable they provided.

First problem I ran into was right away, it wouldn't recognize all 3 monitors. I had the most updated driver already (same for my 3100) but I reinstalled it anyway because why not. It did drive 2 monitors plus my laptop screen like a champ, but the 3rd one didn't recognize at all. If I unplugged one of the DisplayPort connectors, the HDMI lit up and was fine - but as soon as I replugged the DP, HDMI went blank. After a decent bit of research and findings on the displaylink forums, I updated the firmware on the device and got pleasing results. All the monitors now work.

The second (and ultimately the last straw) issue wasn't apparent immediately. The device drove all the monitors and had chargeback just like I wanted, didn't overheat or anything and seemed pretty solid.

Then I went to a meeting with my laptop, and when I brought it back and plugged the dock in (with windows at lock screen) it didn't recognize my keyboard... but it got all my monitors and my mouse, so I figured it was a fluke. I unplugged the keyboard and reseated it, and was good to go. Never had this issue with ~6 weeks use of the 3100. This happened several more times over the next few days.

Then I went to lunch and left the laptop locked. My org power settings shut monitors off after 10 minutes on the lock screen - never been an issue, never was on the 3100.. but when I woke the laptop up, the screens went all flickery and the audio tweaked on all 3 monitors as they individually re-recognized and the display re-extended to them in sequence. Probably about a 20 second process before windows was responsive enough to log me in... this is huge already and happened literally every time I had to wake my displays.. but THEN, the 3rd monitor from my first issue would randomly be sitting at 800x600 and greyed out to change to the 1080 setting it was supposed to be at - necessitating me to unplug the dock altogether, wait for it to finish uninstalling the 9 things attached to it, then re-plug it and wait another 20 for it all to get straight again before I could work. Killing my network connection and suspending sessions with my PSA and other DB tools with improper dismount.

I've only had the thing for 4 days now and I think in that time I've spent more time futzing with it than I did in more than 6 weeks of having to plug in my power adapter alongside the 3100.. and I had zero issues with undocking / hot-docking / locking / waking with the 3100 at all, it worked right out of the box and I only had to buy a usb-c to usb3.0 cable to supplement it.

I did some research on that and it led me to a few settings that are obscure and I tried them to no avail. I attempted another firmware flash from a different PC and again a driver reinstall - same results when waking from locked/display off state.",29,樣式: 單件

PROS
Much smaller than the Dell E-Plus docking station.
No legacy ports. Two Display Ports and one HDMI.
Four USB 3.0 ports (4) and 1 USB-C port
It seemed to work well with a Dell Latitude E7240 even when connected to a USB 2.0 port driving two Dell U2412M monitors @ 1920 x 1200 each.
CONS
1. It does not have an On-Off button. So, I have to open the lid of my PC to turn it on, while with the Dell E-Plus docking station, I could keep the lid closed and turn it on or off using the docking station button. I just read that there are workarounds about this, but I did not find any to be as convenient as Power button in the docking station.
2. It is not Plug-And-Play as it requires downloading and installing third party drivers by DisplayLink, so that meant a call to the IT Tech Support Team for my company provided PC (but not for my own identical PC).
3. I just read that the video signal gets compressed by the PC and then decompressed by the docking station (or something like that) and that this has its own pros and cons.

UPDATE 04/13/2019
I had ordered this Dell docking station D6000 to let's say ""upgrade"" from my Dell E-Plus docking station in my home office. Soon enough, I started noticing that there was a lag in the mouse's response time. Initially, I attributed it to the mouse's batteries and changed them by a new set. It was not it. So, I looked it up online and found that this is one of a number of known issues, and there were several recommendations in DisplayLink's support page... Update the PC's BIOS, check and update drivers, etc, etc. On a company provided computer such as my main PC, this means calls to the IT support team, remote support troubleshooting sessions, multiple-restarts, questions such as ""what was wrong with the company provided E-Plus dock?"" (Answer: nothing really, I just have a case of ""upgraditis""), and there would be no guarantees that the issue would be solved after all those updates. So, together with the lack of Power on-off button, it's starting to look like a ""no-go"" for me.",2,樣式: 單件

The way I use a docking station is that I dock my laptop and it may stay docked for a few minutes, a few hours, or a few days. I can then use the on/off switch to turn the laptop on and off without opening the lid, so the laptop acts like a desktop when it is docked.

I returned this product, and bought a Dell WD19TB dock, which does have an on/off switch. So far, the new dock works.

Unfortunately, the web page for this dock does not address this issue. I not that some of the competing docks have an on/off switch (Dell WD19, Lenovo dock) while others don't (Belkin, etc.).

The bottom line is that if you want to use a dock where you turn your laptop and all of the docked peripherals on and off by opening the lid of the laptop and using the laptop's on/off switch, the Dell 6000 should be a good dock for you. That's especially true if you use the laptop's screen along with the other peripherals. I give the Dell 6000 four stars.

However, if you want to keep the laptop closed while docked, and rely on one or more monitors instead of the laptop screen, you want a dock with an on/off switch.",1,樣式: 單件

So it has been a few weeks with the dock now, and it hasn't given me any trouble. I turn on the laptop, both of my 4K monitors are working fine along with the peripherals.

=======================================================================

I have been a tech enthusiast for the last decade and my first week with this docking station was frustrating.
My rig is an Alienware 17 R3, Win10 64 bit, 1TB NVMe M.2 2280 SSD for boot and applicaitons, 1TB SSD for storage, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 970m GPU, and i7 6700HQ CPU.

The purpose of purchasing this specific docking station was for the horizontal design, USB C capability, and its 3 x 4K port connectivity. I am only utilizing 2 of the ports (HDMI and displayport) and my set up keeps switching from 4K resolution to 2048 x 1152 or 1920 x 1080. I thought this would be a simple driver issue so I uninstalled the displaylink driver I already had from my previous docking station and updated it to the most recent version. Still didn't fix the issue. So I tried a few different setups...one worked out fine with me by using the USB C portion instead of the USB 3.0 adapter alongside a Displayport to HDMI cable and HDMI to HDMI cable, both supporting 4K resolution. I haven't had any issues for the second week now and I will update.

PROS
+small, horizontal design
+affordable (cheaper than the typical 200 dollar docking stations with USB C)
+optional USB 3.0 or USB C connectivity
+4 USB 3.0 ports, 2 DisplayPort, and 1 HDMI

Campbell,4.0,2017-10-14 00:00:00,美國,,"My friend and I use these docks with our Dell Latitude 7480 ultrabooks, both of which are Thunderbolt 3 equipped and capable of passing display info, USB and charging over the same USB C cable. After installing the DisplayPort driver on both laptops per the enclosed instructions and rebooting the PC, everything was plug and play, with a couple of quirks, which I'll outline below:

First, the docking station does not have an on-off switch, which means you need to connect it AFTER the computer has been turned on. While you can restart with the dock attached, you need to follow this ""reconnect"" procedure any other time the computer has been shut down, as not doing so can result in some of your devices not being recognized by the dock.

Second, there are some scenarios where Windows 10's ability to support multiple monitors with different font scaling and resolutions can be a bit buggy when using this dock. While my setup, which has a 1080p display on the laptop and two 1080p external monitors plugged into the dock worked as expected (being able to set font scaling separately for the laptop and my external displays separately without a problem), my friend's laptop, also has a 1080p display, but a U3415W as the external monitor, was a bit more quirky.

When we plugged the dock into his computer for the first time, his external monitor displayed 1080p as well, which is well below the native resolution of the monitor (3440x1440). To get everything to work correctly, we set the resolution and font scaling for the external display in Windows, then disconnected the laptop from the dock, and reset font scaling for the laptop's smaller display. From that point forward, the two displays worked as expected when used separately, but when the laptop is plugged into the dock with it's display open, it still tries to match the scaling of the larger display. While this was not a deal-breaker in my friend's scenario, be aware this could happen with your setup as well, particularly if you're trying to mix and match resolutions between the display on the laptop and any external displays.

Overall I'm very happy with these docks and would recommend these (or the  Plugable USB-C Triple Display Docking Station with Charging Support/Power Delivery for Specific Windows and Mac USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 Systems ) to anyone looking for a good Thunderbolt 3 dock.",114,樣式: 單件

Before trying the Dell D6000, I tried CalDigit TS3+ and Cable Matters USB-C docks and non of them drove my dell, but worked with my Lenovo.
And finally I got the dell D6000 that detected both laptops like a champ and drives my displays at their highest resolution. I mounted it on the back of my display so no cable is visible on my desk, just a USB-C cable that charges my laptop and provide connectivity to my mouse, keyboard, webcam and boss speakers.

If I want to mention disadvantage of dell D6000 they would be lack of ports (comparing to the CalDigit):
- Lack of fiber audio port for my Boss speaker, I should use USB connection instead (a little lower quality)
- Lack of number of USB-A ports. D6000 offers only 4 USB-A ports which are already utilized.
- Lack of SD Card slot - I have to purchase a separate USB-C to SD Card connector and attach it to D6000.

However, as long as it worked for me and addressed almost my requirements (with some workarounds), I would be happy to give it a 5 star considering my bad experience with CalDigit and Cable Matters. I have not done speed test yet though that is my real concern anyway. So I give it a pass.

NOTE: The CalGigit dock is a Thuderbolt 3 dock and it is not supposed to work my dell Latitude 3490 by design (my mistake to buy it in first place). So if you have laptops that support TB3, the CalDigit might be a better option considering its variety and number of ports. However it comes with a high price $304.

NOTE: The Cable Connect dock, on the other hand was a USB-C dock that did not work with my dell latitude USB-C port which was disappointing. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I did not have to worry about return.",3,樣式: 單件

One USB-C plug to run 3 monitors, handle sound, and even charge(except in my case, the 16 inch MBP needs a slightly higher wattage, so I would have used my 96W power adapter anyway).
I got it all set up and installed the software to run 3 montiors. Beautiful. I moved on from using 2 dongles + manually plugging in my speakers, to running all of that on one dongle.

But shortly after, I wondered ""why is the display I plugged in via hdmi showing my nightshift/f.lux but the two displays I plugged in via display port not working with it? This is going to hurt my eyes if I don't fix it.""

I looked it up online, and for years(yes, at least 3 years), people have constantly asked the dell displaylink support to fix this issue so that nightshift actually works with this dock, but this has never been fixed. After seeing that Dell would not fix this issue, and that I'd be stuck without using nightshift if I wanted to continue using this dock, I decided instantly that I wouldn't be keeping this.
If it's having nightshift on all my monitors and plugging in 3 total cables vs having two of my monitors not usable with nightshift and plugging in 1 cable, I'll easily opt for the having to spend an extra few seconds to plug some cables in to save my eyes.
I also tried f.lux and that had the exact same issue as nightshift.

Another thing I don't like is that the two displayport monitors are software driven. So you have to run the displaylink software whenever you want to use those two monitors. In other words, those monitors won't even turn on until the displaylink software is started while using the D6000 This doesn't happen when I use my two dongles each handling their share of my 3 monitors.

You almost had me Dell, but please fix your nightshift/f.lux issue and maybe I'll reconsider.",0,樣式: 單件

I love this unit, USB's work, and it even charges if you have a Dell Thunderbolt connection.

Why do I like it, well I learned that Dell outsources production of this device (D6000) dock, and therefore it's compatible with many/most computers. I have tried other models in my HP, and none of them work. (Note: I have not tried 3 monitors connected to my HP laptop, but I've been told by tech support that it's able to support it.)

I don't really understand why companies make devices that only work with their stuff. Meaning they could sell more and make greater profits if (like this device) it's compatible with anything.

I installed the DisplayLink drivers and the Dell recommended drivers and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I jut bought my second one to use on site for my contract jobs.

It *DOES* charge the 9560 but you'll get the BIOS power adapter warning, but you can turn it off (as well as set the AC power to primary use to prolong your 9560 battery life). As for the MacBook, I downloaded the DisplayLink driver and used the USB-3 adapter on the plug (I have the USB-C models) and the built-in display and both Dell monitors look fantastic. It's great only having 1 plug (or 2 if you need the AC for intensive use) to grab-n-go.

I have occasionally experienced mouse hesitation but it's only evident without the regular AC adapter plugged in. I also used the Alpha DisplayLink Drivers for my Dell and that helped.

The sound is good, I can use Gigabit Ethernet on my laptop and have extra ports and much neater cables. I'm glad got it and I'm sure it'll work for other laptops later.

I got a sweet deal using a site that rhymes with Hamill x3. Check the Warehouse Deals too, that's where this one came from.

UPDATE July 2018
After living with it for a while, I need to dock some stars...
It can't handle 4k very well. If you text edit or browse using _only the dock for power_ you will literally hear it screech from pain while trying to keep up and render content. YouTube will lose sync in full screen making it look like an old dubbed kung-fu movie. If you use CorelDRAW! or the like, it will crash frequently because the dock's video chip can't handle it. Using the laptop's HDMI out solves these issues, but that's not a lot of help with a dual-4k setup.

If you need graphical performance while driving a pair of 4k monitors, I'd have to steer towards using an eGPU chassis and a Quadro or GTX 1070 with a Thunderbolt 3 out to reconnect LAN, Sound, etc.",33,樣式: 單件

If that doesn't matter to you, this is a very good dock solution. If it does, then this is not going to work.

Initially May 2020, connected to Dell XPS 15 and two Samsung 27"" (2560x1444) monitors via DisplayPort cable, the two monitors would work but not the laptop screen, or the laptop screen and not the monitors, so we kept the screen closed enough to disable the screen. Since the computer was used for photo editing, including portraits, we used the ColorMunki photospectrometer and software to create color profiles. All is fine.

Now comes late October and the system crashed and could not recover. Dell checked the hardware and found OK, so had me download a new factory image for the drive. Computer, as far as it knows, is brand new. After a week of installing software, Windows updates, Dell updates, etc. now the two monitors connected to the D6000 will work at the same time as the built in laptop screen. Only one problem--we can no long create monitor profiles, as the ColorMunki fails in a couple different ways. My best guess is that when we reinstalled everything, we must have gotten the latest DisplayLink driver for the D6000--and that fixed one problem we didn't care about while creating a new one that rendered the computer-dock-monitors setup unusable for its intended purpose.",1,樣式: 單件

While this is true, it still keeps the laptop charged so it’s a nonissue. To remove the warning you just need to go into BIOS settings on start up and turn off the power adaptor warning.

My mother in law visits frequent from cross country and she just got a new laptop to travel with her so she can work remotely. Rather than work off the laptop I figured I'd try a universal doc.

It has two Display ports and one HDMI and can drive all three monitors over usb-3 or usb-C. The monitors I'm running on it now are a pair of Dell Ultrasharp U2715H monitors at 2560x1440.

I bought two other brands of universal docs, and they couldn't match the display resolution this one does. I't is very small and unassuming. The attachment to your laptop has a native usb-c connector, and attached to it is a USB-3, no hunting around for the right cable to connect it up.

If you want to drive 2 high resolution office productivity monitors from one usbc/usb3 connection this is the way to go, just make sure to get quality video cables for it to work optimally. Cheap cables can flak out on you causing more trouble than it's worth (I speak from experience).",45,樣式: 單件

Bit expensive but love the fact that you just have to plug a single USB-C or USB 3 cable (comes attached with the dock; USB-C converts to USB 3) and you've got everything working smoothly. I attach USB-C cable from dock my 13.3"" laptop to get all of the below benefits seamlessly...

2. Worked keyboard & mouse

3. Headphone

4. It automatically charges laptop back with the same cable (at 90W Dell power supply)

5. External drive (flash drive)

In the past, I've used the TB15 (a Thunderbolt dock that was a poor design, rarely worked, and was quickly replaced by the TB16), the TB16 (a bit better than the TB15, but only a little), the WD15 (a non-Thunderbolt USB-C dock that also had RF issues and was quirky in general).

This is basically a WD15 (USB-C, plus video over Alt-mod), with a 6000-series Displaylink hung off the USB hub, driving two display outputs.

It all just works. I'm using two 4k monitors.

Before buying, do understand the limitations of Displaylink: It's great for general usage, but not usable for performance intensive games. The Displaylink video goes over USB, so it competes with ethernet and everything else except for the alt-mode video.

Alt mode on HDMI drives my 4k monitor at 30Hz, which is fine for my general office usage. It claims to be able to do 60Hz, but honestly, I've not tried and I'm using a crappy HDMI cable, so it might be possible.

Setup : Lenovo Yoga 900/Dell U2417H monitor/Dell D600 dock/Dell AE515M Soundbar/Windows 10
The expected behavior is to have the Dell D600 as the default audio device. If headphones are connected sound should go to it.
If headphones are not connected and the line-out is not connected the audio should go to the next device in the list (The Soundbar).
The problem is that the D600 dock shows always as enabled even if no headphones/lineout is connected.
In contrast the microphone in the D6000 shows as disconnected if no headphone/lineout is connected.
Trying to find alternative workarounds using other soundbars shows another problem:
If you connect headphones to the D6000 and you have a lineout device, the sound is not cut to the lineoutput device. So you get sound from your speakers and headphones.

I this D6000 when the WD-15 I had finally died. A couple of things you need to be aware of:

1) The Intel UHD graphics software on my computer doesn't see the D6000. Period. Can't configure the monitors through the Intel software, so I had to resort to using the built-in Windows 10 software (not as robust).
2) This unit does NOT support D-port daisy chain. You have to plug each monitor directly into the D6000.
3) The USB C-to-A adapter is permanently attached to the cable, for some reason. It's awkward and takes up space. You can cut it off if you're connecting to your computer via USB-C - but Dell should have make it removable so you don't have to pull out an Xacto knife to cut off the damned adapter.
4) The cable from the dock to the computer is permanently attached, meaning you're stuck with that length cable. Period.
5) Don't even think about trying upgrade the D6000 firmware through a non-Dell computer. The installer is written so it looks for a Dell computer configuration first, so if you've got a non-Dell computer (like me, I've got an HP), you can't do it.

I'm sure there are other docking stations out there, but this one was relatively inexpensive ($130), even though it has quirks. On the plus side, the monitors don't flicker like they did with the WD-15.",0,樣式: 單件

Both due to charging and audio issues.

Before ordering, I contacted Dell customer support to see if this would work with my new Alienware 17R5. The specs say it will send 65W to charge, and the Alienware takes a lot more than that. I decided to skip at first, but then saw a few people claiming it would in fact charge my Alienware. I was dubious, so I contacted Dell technical support via online chat. They told me that, yes, it would indeed charge the Alienware. So I went from ""nope, can't get a dock like I want ever"" to ""found a dock that'll work!"".

Then the product arrived, and sure enough, it did not charge the laptop at all. And yes, I was using the USB-C connection. Googling a bit more I came across a FAQ on Dell's own site that confirmed that the dock will NOT charge the Alienware. Wish I had found that before contacting Dell techs support.

Given the relatively decent price and easy connection process (ethernet and hdmi for now), I figured try it out a bit, maybe I won't care about the lack of charging (tho part of the reason I like legacy docks was a single cord / connection). Unfortunately it didn't take me long to find a different problem - audio. When I perform a speaker test on the audio sent via the dock to my HDMI monitor, only the left channel came through. I swapped HDMI cables to see if that was the issue, but unfortunately I couldn't resolve. I then hooked it up to a friend's laptop, and had the exact same issue. Switched the cable back to my desktop and audio to that monitor worked fine. I'm guessing this was a defect in my particular unit, but can't swear to that.

At this point I've initialized a return, which is a bummer - time and money wasted due to Dell tech support.",4,樣式: 單件

Downloaded the drives from the dell site, plugged in and worked without any issue first time through.

At least for my model, the USB C is not powerful enough to power the laptop so I still ahve to use a charger. I'm sure there are some laptops that will charge over USBC, which would be a huge plus. Dell/Windows is at least nice enough to have prompted me onscreen that there wasn't enough power.

I like the USBC cable comes in a USB3 adaptor thing. Not sure what that's for exactly, I suppose if you jsut wanted to use it as a hub instead of doing displays.

Device does get warm, which is slightly annoying, but I don't have other docks to compare it to.

It would also be nice if windows (and adobe) would autodetect the hub has been connected and automatically switch over the audio profiles to use the hub (or use the laptop when disconnected).",1,樣式: 單件

I used this dock from my previous IT job and it worked well with a Dell laptop. I could not find a dock that is comparable for my new MacBook Pro so I checked and this dock is compatible. I just needed to install the Displaylink drivers on my mac.

Pros:
This dock uses a single USB-C type cable to:
- Charge the laptop
- USB 3.0 hub with 4 ports and one USB-C connection
- 2 Displays, hdmi is disabled if using both displayports
- Audio
- Ethernet adapter

No other USB-C cables will work. Dell, of course, won't sell just that cable, so be prepared to buy another one if something happens to that cable, or ideally find something else.

So had hoped for the best and so far have definitely not been disappointed. I checked again, and their rating is still very high, and well deserved.

For starters I placed my order with Amazon on 28 June. Delivery schedule was for 5-6 July. My Dell Optiplex 7050 arrived on 30 June. In great shape.

Connecting the computer to my new Dell monitor was effortless. My first experience with using HDMI instead of VGA. I'm only using one monitor, so of course am having no issues. However while I was Googling a variety of Dell Optiplex 7050 to-do's I noticed a few users having issues with installing two monitors. There is only one HDMI that really works - as far as I can see.

A great and very welcome surprise was the DVD drive. In the photo of the Dell Optiplex 7050 at Amazon it looked as though it would not come with a DVD drive. So what a wonderful surprise that was. Have used it a few times and it works as it should.

I thought WiFi would be internally built in, and must have misunderstood. There is a WiFi Adapter USB that is included with the computer but the WiFi is not internal. This was not an issue for me as I had been planning to use an ethernet cable anyway - my preferred mode of WiFi for desktop computers. I also didn't need the mouse and keyboard, although brand new and of good quality. The keyboard and mouse that came with the Optiplex were wired, and my preference is for wireless, and I had that ready and waiting for including with my new computer.

Windows 10 Professional worked well from the get go. Definitely a tribute to the high quality tech input of MST MEMORY SOLUTION INC. It was effortless to set it up. Only headache is one that all Windows 10 users experience, which is how to get rid of the automatic startup page of Microsoft Edge. Took me some time to figure out, without needing to go into the Registry. Thanks to some savvy high-tech sources on the Internet.

I haven't gone high tech on my Dell Optiplex 7050 yet and it is probably early days with working with it. I know Dell has a great Website for updating Bios and everything else, but thought for now I didn't need it. Everything is working super fast and feels updated.

One thing I had to get used to is that all of the 1 TB SSD space came unpartitioned on C: only. I'm used to a partitioning of the disk with programs on C: and data on D: After some Googling on the subject looks like it doesn't really make a huge difference with SSD (like it would have with HD) and that partitioning isn't really needed. So looks like I need to beef up on how to optimize Windows Explorer App for arranging my D: files for easy reach.

So still early days using my Dell Optiplex 7050, but very happy so far. Thanks to MST MEMORY SOLUTION INC.",23,樣式: 32G/1T SSD

It never worked as it should for more than a matter of hours, and displayed a wide variety of problems (see below for a sample). The last straw was when I closed the Chrome browser and the whole screen went black. The mouse pointer was visible, but nothing else. There was nothing to click on, so I couldn't even shut it down. After a couple of hard reboots this problem persisted, so the machine is now on its way back to SJ Computers. No one is to blame -- there's just a ghost in this machine.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Bought the Dell i7-7050 SFF. It arrived in good shape two days early, but I didn't have the correct video cables (VGA to Display Port), so I didn't turn it on for a couple of days. Once I had the cables I fired it up, set up Windows and left it running for several hours, when it began to display various display anomalies: When I opened programs, the window would display for a second or two, then disappear. Later, the whole screen began flashing on and off. The Start button didn't work so I had to shut it down with the power switch.

With the machine unusable, I called SJ Computers (the seller). This was on a Friday, and I spoke to two techs, Alex and Logan. Much troubleshooting was tried, and eventually the machine seemed to be stable and I was told to use it over the weekend and call back with a progress report on Sunday. I used it as much as I could, and it randomly logged itself off several times. When the ""disappearing window"" symptom reappeared on Sunday I thought I needed a replacement, and I called to ask for one.

This time I spoke to Aaron, a third tech, who logged into the machine remotely to try and resolve the issues. He ran some diagnostic and repair tools, and in the end suggested a complete reinstall of Windows. Since I had not installed anything on the computer, I agreed to that. I now have a completely fresh installation of Windows that seems to be working, and I'm hoping all will be well over time.

AARON WAS THOROUGH, COURTEOUS AND PROFESSIONAL DURING THIS LENGTHY PROCESS, and put my mind somewhat at ease by offering to extend the 90-day warranty for an extra thirty days. He went the extra mile by calling me back an hour or so after the Windows reset to make sure all was well. This computer will be used in mission-critical situations and I can't afford random shutdowns or on-screen controls that don't work. Since these problems were intermittent I can't honestly say that it's ""fixed,"" but I fully expect it to be.

For the past couple of hours this computer has been working fine, but I will update this review if there are further problems with it.",38,樣式: 32G/1T SSD

I bought it for basic functions for running basic word documents, spreadsheets, and paying bills etc. and am pleased with it. Takes an extra second or two to open a second spreadsheet, but I am okay with that. However, this is advertised as WiFi and Bluetooth. These features are not internal but done with USB adapters. The WiFi adapter they sent me was VERY slow, when it worked at all, making the PC appear very bad. My router is about 20 feet from this computer and my work computer, TV's, and everything else works just fine on fiber optic internet. I connected an Ethernet cable straight into the PC and it is like a different machine, opening web pages very fast. Second, the Bluetooth adapter they sent would not transmit past my monitors 3 feet from the PC. I literally had to hold my headset behind the monitor to get it to connect and it would loose connection when I sat down. Total junk. I ordered a $12 Bluetooth adapter and I can go to the next room. Third, the power cable they sent me did not hold into the plug on the PC very well and if you moved the tower, it would loose connection and shutdown. I have multiple power cords and simply replaced it and the issue is solved.

In conclusion, for the money the PC is great and does what I want it to but only after I made the upgrades to the accessories. If they would send a decent quality WiFi adapter and Bluetooth adapter I would have given it 5 stars. The plug I don't see as a regular issue, but unless they upgrade the adapters they send you, plan on ordering those for yourself.",6,樣式: 32G/1T SSD

I returned the first one of these Dell 9050 sff computers due to a starting problem which may have been a power supply problem or mismatched ram memory chips but I really liked this computer. I ordered another one because it came very clean and painted so cosmetic looks 5 star. The unit did run very well except for shut down problems. I did replace the MB cmos battery which was at a very low voltage but apparently Dell has had a few problems with random shutdowns and start button being difficult to start. I believe this is something that I'm willing to buy another and hope it works fine. These are nice desktops and with some TLC are well worth the roughly $230 at this time. Parts are widely available and inexpensive so hoping this new to me unit works as well as the half dozen or so refurbished computers I have bought in the past. The second computer is up and running and after two days no problems. Hats off to the Microsoft refurbisher great job, nice desktop computer. this is updated 081523",9,樣式: 32G/1T SSD

The BIOS needed some updates and needed to be set to use hyperthreading. Windows set up worked great. The keyboard and mouse supplied were the cheapest quality imaginable - no, cheaper than that. But they worked, I just would not want to use either.

Things are going well with the machine. I'm using it with two displays - a 4K 32"" curved Dell plugged right into the display port and another display in the VGA analog port. Adding a display adapter would require a short one - the case is compact. You could add a couple more SSD's. I won't need more storage for this machine and I probably won't add a display adapter.

Being one who can't leave well enough alone, I immediately added a second SSD, which required ordering some cables--splitting the power and connecting to a second SATA port. Scavenged video and sound cards from the computer this replaced, and everything works great. All the specs are correct. In general, a good deal. (Since reviews sometimes get applied to different products on this site, it's the Dell Optiplex 7050 SFF Desktop PC Intel i7-7700 4-Cores 3.60GHz 32GB DDR4 model I'm talking about.)

The only trouble was temperature issues. The CPU and mainboard started running hot--not right after the additions, but a couple of weeks in. Weird temp spikes came and went. From a comfy low 40s C, leaping for no reason up to 70, 80, and once passing a frightening 95 C! I don't do any gaming or heavy lifting, and the temp freakouts happened under low loads and seemingly at random. Not a speck of dust to clog things up, either. I feared my upgrades had messed something up... I reset the fan control in the BIOS so it'd stay cranked all the time, and that helped, but it was LOUD! Tonight I realized some old thermal paste was in the electro-junk drawer, so I pulled the fan out, cleaned the old gunk off and re-pasted it. Set the fan BIOS back to normal. Bam! Sitting now at 41C for the CPU, 37C mainboard. Otherwise, I'm a happy camper.

If I were less brash with digging into the components, I might have given up and returned this one, or not have known it was cooking like an air fryer in there until it was too late. So, the 4-star rating is a stretch. It's 4 stars AFTER some fiddling around.",24,樣式: 32G/1T SSD

Update: After about three weeks of daily use I started getting Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) crashes. They were happening on a daily basis. I had read one other reviewers experience with this and it was related to processor core temperatures. When I checked my unit, all four cores were running hot. I ordered some silicon thermal grease from Amazon. I pulled the chiller and there was not much grease on the processor at all. I cleaned everything thoroughly and applied an ample amount of grease to both the processor and chiller. It has been a week now and no BSoD crashes.

No issues and a perfect fit for this project.

I did run the Benchmark 24hour burn in test and it passed with a few errors that are maintenance related. CPU thermal compound needs refreshed/ replaced. After that, temps dropped by 10° C.
My take away:
If you need a power machine for an appliance, that is what you will get. No idea about gaming or routine tasks. The SFF has some inherent cooling issues due to the small form factor. Inside was very clean with no dust.

Some things to think about and consider:
-Free keyboard and mouse are very basic. Plan on replacing them
-You will need to order video adapters, if you want to plug in a monitor. I’d rather see the package include this instead of the mouse/keyboard and wireless adapter.
-1Tb SSD is manufactured by Suneast. Chinese brand with not much documentation, would not 100% rely on it. Consider a name brand replacement.
-Perception of shipping package is not great, no dents and machine was in working order.
-If you are considering this a cheap buy to put into a new case and build up, look for a mid-tower unit instead. Too many Dell proprietary connectors that will need additional adapters.

Overall 5 star for a power user. 3.5-4 if you are a novice.",13,樣式: 32G/1T SSD

It is a work desktop, not a gaming desktop so it shares memory for video.
Has a card expansion slot if you want to try adding a graphics card.

I will correct the review of the system if they are able to resolve the issue. The system worked fine for the couple of days. It started showing issues of restarting on its own. The restart happens after each restart and keeps on going until the system is completely turned off. Called the SJ computers and the technician was able to identify that the hard drive is faulty. They sent me a return label to send the hard drive to the seller and promised that they will send me a new harddrive in 3-4 days. Waiting for the New hard drive now. Got a call from Sarah from the tech support and informed me that they are working on the new hard drive. so the customer care seems to be good as off now.

So the computer arrived and is in working order, but the windows 10 was YEARS old and required HOURS of updates (there goes my bandwidth for the month). This alone is enough for me to tell you not to buy this computer unless you know what your doing, as it is so out of date that it throws errors when trying to update.

The included mouse was dead on arrival and wouldn't click, but I might be able to repurpose as a maraca as the rattle of internal broken parts is quite loud.

The keyboard was packaged in a plastic bag and placed directly on the computer, so that when the box got flipped upside down the full weight of the computer damaged the keyboard and even tore open the bag. When I saw it I though wow, fight with a blender recently?

the promised WiFi and Bluetooth adapters are completely missing, no empty bags or boxes, not already installed, completely missing.

but like I said, you don't buy a computer for the peripherals, but and extra layer of bubble wrap and the mouse and keyboard would of arrived in good condition, if this had gotten one good jolt in shipping with a lose keyboard and mouse in the wrong position and the computer would of been dead or badly damaged on arrival.

At day 92, I had a processor problem that required a system reset. That same problem is beginning to reappear now. Yesterday, the left screen hinge broke after opening and closing it probably 100 times or less. Dell requires that you box up the laptop ( with all your personal/Financial/Banking/Password information- unless you do a factory reset to erase everything) and send it off to them where they will repair it and send it back. I am not a fan of giving someone the ability to copy my hard drive (which they will do) and possibly have God only knows who, obtain a copy of all my data. They will not offer an ETA on the repaired laptop even if I were to agree to that.

I've bought Dell's for 30 years for my entire family. This is an absolute pile of garbage. You get what you pay for. Shame on me, I almost bought a MacBook because of reviews I read- but I saved on price. Now I am paying the ""Cost"".",0,樣式: 筆記型電腦

I wanted something lighter, faster and ready to handle the student workload I have right now.
So you can imagine my surprise and frustration when I got it and the led screen is dull and not bright at all. My old Dell has a better brighter picture than my new one.
WHEN I can get the battery to charge it’s holds for about an hour and half before it’s almost dead. And that’s only after I discovered that the charging cord they sent with it isn’t compatible and in bad shape. So I used my old one…it worked. In the pic above I’ve had it charging for over an hour already.
I am very disappointed in this expensive purchase that I now have to deal with because of the payments I’m having to make on it. I’m also in a remote location that does not have big box electronics stores where I can just walk in and look at another one. Ordering is our only option.

My wireless mouse employs a simple older USB dongle. In hindsight I should have spent the money for a non-dongle bluetooth wireless mouse. I’ve used a couple of the other ports (HDMI and second monitor), but with a lot less frequency and urgency than I thought I would. Overall I might not have needed this in the first place.
My biggest complaint is the tether. If I’m using an external (wireless dongle) mouse I essentially have to use my laptop as a desktop because of the adapter hanging off one of the ports. I can’t really use a lap desk and sit in the lounge chair or on the couch using my laptop as a laptop. An adapter like this that uses either WiFi, bluetooth, or some proprietary micro dongle technology to leave the adapter on a desk (or coffee table) and free my laptop from the desk would be much more useful and appreciated. (Though it would require its own power source, I know.)
Overall it’s an adequate and useful device, but it really does physically restrict the usefulness of a laptop.",2,

I’m can still get it by plugging one monitor into the original computer but it kind of impacts your ability to hide your ugly cords. I also would have liked to have seen an audio jack.

But the bigger takeaway is if you have Apple M1 in your computer, pass on this usb hub. I'm sure it's fine with windows as Dell's hubs are usually super good. That's the reason I bought it. I know them to usually make great usb hubs and docking stations. But this hub was a disappointment.",4,

You stand a strong chance of getting something with some, majority, or critical functionality not working, and if you are lucky, you too can damage a monitor or two with your purchase.

The 4.5mm connector felt a little ""loose"" to my liking when plugged in but all was functional without any issues. For the record all Dell power supplies are center positive. My original 65W supplied 19.5v.

I hit F2 to go to bios on the Inspiron and it said the battery was being charged by a 130 watt power supply. I now have 2x the power to keep the battery charging and laptop going full speed at the same time. What a great product.",0,

All you've really got to work with are the Display Port and DVI port at the bottom on the graphics card. It also doesn't have an HDMI port. They send an HDMI adapter to plug in the other port. The instruction sheet that comes with it is also misleading in that it tells you to plug your monitor into any of the ports - including the VGA and non-existent HDMI (and shows pictures of them.) At the least - they could have explained this on the instruction sheet. I contacted technical support and they did contact me quickly and explained what was going on. They said if I wanted to use the other ports I would have to remove the graphics card. I was really wanting to hook 3 monitors up so may try that.

My package was also missing the Bluetooth adapter. They are supposed to be sending that to me.

I knew I was taking a chance - while the specs on paper were better, buying refurbished felt like a gamble, and this PC is several years old at this point. Experts would have told me to get a new PC with better specs I'm sure, but I was willing to take a chance at this price. I didn't want to have to pay around $1,000 for a good PC if I could avoid it.

I had an initial hiccup - Davinci Resolve kept crashing within minutes of me opening it up and trying to do something. It seemed strange because it loaded a lot quicker and seemed to have much better handling than my old PC before crashing. It went from seemingly great to dead in an instant - not like it was struggling to begin with.

I almost gave up and was considering returning the PC, but I decided to try updating the graphics card driver. When I went through the device settings, it told me I already had the most up to date driver. But I went online and downloaded the driver software and ran it anyway, and it looks like there was actually a newer version of it. Thankfully, this seems to have fixed the issue. I tested it out a bit and did a render without issue. I suggest everyone do this if you're getting this PC. See what the graphics card is under device manager, search online for the most up to date driver (preferably from the manufacturer's own website and a third party website) to make sure it's up to date and you have no issues.",18,

The Amazon page for this problem of missing parts gives you the number for Dell, but when you contact Dell your name doesn't appear on the order so after the time it takes to get one of their support people and go through their routine, they refuse to help! Going back to Amazon, and being passed around to at least 3 different departments, the only ""solution"" any of them could offer was to ship the whole shebang back to them and have them send another which might not have all the parts. I'm in MEXICO. I already paid customs and extra shipping and all I need is a $3 part! I've already paid an expert to come and figure out how to patch the proper wire, also not included, to the router to access internet and get the computer set up. Now send it back and cross my fingers? Because that's the solution for all problems? That's more in shipping costs than the computer costs. Can you get me the part number so I can track it down on my own and buy it from somewhere? NO! Send the whole thing back. Eat what you are out and go back to square one where you were 3 weeks ago, cross your fingers and hope the one we send has all it's parts and works, etc. etc. IT'S OUR ONLY OPTION!

Now the rest is very positive. It came with a new Windows 10. All the user has to do is register and add the programs they use. The computer is fast and works great.

It came with a USB wireless connector which worked fine for setting up, then I went ethernet when I was finished getting it ready. It accepted the ethernet automatically, and I plugged in my USB printer and it worked without any extra effort. I should have checked closer on the monitor connections, this one uses DisplayPort (it does say this in the description online but I missed it), I was expecting HDMI.

But, you say, “What about the Amazon return policy, blah blah blah.” Look, it's NOT enough if you need likety split dial-up customer support. I ordered a Dell Optiplex 9010 and needed help. Dialed the S.J. Computers support number and a LIVE Super Tech answered. We chat, he resolved, replacement a part shipped, and all was good. YMMV but my experience S.J.C., the Super Tech and customer service were all five stars. BTW, I'm VERY (note caps) happy with my refurb Dell.",2,

That card solved all issues and in running 4k now. Was very disappointed to have to go thru all that just to get the monitor to work. Smh.

In fact, in order to use my laptop and this dock, I have to have 2 power supplies.

I know/understand that my laptop to be fully supported needs 210W and that this only would have delivered 130W at most. But because I'm not running the laptop at full blast all the time, I would have expected it to use 130W while consuming the battery for the remaining amount and while the laptop is idle slowly charge it up and such.

Instead, what happens os that the dock provides 0W of power to the laptop and of course the dock doesn't work without a power supply of its own so I ended up having to have 2 big power bricks in order to use the dock with my laptop and have to (un)plug in 2 things instead of 1.

Taking off the 1 start due to the unclear and confusing verbiage that implied that I could make some use of the power delivery system even if at lower power when really it delivers 0 power instead.",5,顏色: 黑色

The good:
It charges! The ports work! Getting great transfer speeds! It's built well and hasn't had any problems so far. I'm running 2 displays off of it, one 2k 60hz via DP, and one portable 1080p ProArt via the thunderbolt in the back of the WD19TBS. I'm also running a USB hub, and a 4TB SSD directly from it via the USB C Gen 3.2 in the front. No disconnection issues that i've seen.

The bad:
I can't run 3 monitors off of the dock. It should be possible, the included instructions show how you can do even possibly up to 4 displays off the dock with compatible computers, but something isn't compatible via Apple. Thankfully, there's an HDMI out on the Macbook Pro so I can get my 4k screen via that, with the other 2 monitors off of the dock.
Only one of the two DPs and one HDMI port in the back will work for me at a time. If I use 2 of those, it looks like it splits the signal and mirrors it on both screens. You can get around that by using a USB C to DP cable and plug the second monitor in via the thunderbolt port.

It was between this or the Razer TB4 dock, since the new Caldigit docks are impossible to find right now. I've heard there has been some bugs with the Razer, so I'm glad I went with this. It may not be a perfect fit, but the Dell products I have owned over the years are all still working flawlessly, so I have more trust in them than Razer.",41,顏色: 黑色

There was always need for a good dock at home and after having immense troubles with TB16 and other manufacturers like Accell and Startech docks, finally paid premium price for this one from Dell WD19TBS.

First power delivery of 130W requirement for 9550. Initially I had TB16 and was never even close to charging fully. Had terrible issues with it Dell support amid compatibility issues, this one delivers 130W perfectly over Thunderbolt 3 port. Other docks as mention above do not even come close to charging the laptop!

Secondly as you have seen in above photograph, XPS 9550 along with WD19TBS drives 3 4k displays, 2 of them at 60hz while third one at 30hz (but then it is monitor limitation) along with native UHD resolution of 9550 itself. This is like paradise to me working from home as my job demands it!

However, I have to say that its not all bed of roses with straight plug-ins and up you go! Had to go over firmware updates on 9550 including the software update for TI chip over power delivery and Intel chip drivers, microsoft hid drivers that do not show up in regular SW update check. Mind it that these drivers or FW updates do not even show up straight in Dell Drivers either! It took me 4 days to get the system up and running.

So far the system has been running for a solid week and it has neither crashed nor blinked while working! I am a happy camper with this one finally and don't think of changing laptops for long time...",7,顏色: 黑色

So I was apprehensive about shelling out $250 for something that filled the same function as what I had, but I'm glad I did. This Dell one works seamlessly. It outputs to both my dual monitors at their max 1440p resolution, charges my laptop at full strength, and does so with both my personal and work laptops. I'm not fidgeting with the connection and checking drivers every so often - it just works. There's a quick fan noise right when you plug it in, but it runs super cool and I've never heard the fan kick on otherwise.

I got them both up and running smoothly, but I can only plug (1) of my 4k monitors into the Dell docking station. The other monitor is plugged directly into the HDMI port on my MacBook Pro. I have my keyboard, mouse, headphones, and etc all plugged into the docking station and they are all working beautifully. To top it off, I am powering the MacBook Pro through the Thunderbolt port. So to my Apple family, IT WORKS! Just know that you'll have to use the HDMI port on your mac in addition to the Dell docking station if you are wanting to plug in a dual monitor setup.

While it does sort of work, the power supply for the docking station provides around 130 watts of power. Of that, only 90watts is actually delivered to the laptop. Here is the problem: The newer Alienware laptops, and specifically the higher end laptops, required a 330Watt power supply. While the laptop will adjust, BIOS will complain about it, and it will slow the computer performance. After talking to tech support (Not sales) i learned that Alienware branded machines do not currently have an ""approved"" or ""compatible"" docking station. They expect you to use the ports provided on the laptop itself and just plug everything in every time. Best advise? buy a 2nd power supply for travel, and forget about using a docking station. Its a really nice idea, but Dell sales is not going to give you the correct info.

Given the price of this dock, the fact that the onboard LAN was nothing more than a USB ethernet adapter is really disappointing. Something else that'd already been stated was the fact that only one of the three display connections could be used at a time on the M1 pro and M1 max based Macs. All of that said, the power requirement of the M1 max was met; which, makes this one of the only docks that can supply sufficient power to this particular laptop, but given the compatibility problems, it's just not worth it.

This is an excellent monitor to purchase if you want to functionally create a desktop without spending a large amount of money on a brand new computer. I used purchased this to connect to my laptop to create a functioning pseudocomputer for studying/working.

Pros:
- Very affordable compared to other monitors of similar quality
- Simple assembly and attachment to the stand
- video quality is great. (it was a little bright for my taste so i reduced the brightness to 40% to limit eye strain
- There is no delay between the input on my laptop and what i am seeing on the monitor

Cons
- you could definitely find better picture quality at higher price points

My excitement with this otherwise high quality monitor was premature. A very subtle flickering is going on. At first it seems perfect. But as you work and stare and glance down at your keyboard, you realize there is a subtle flickering going on - at all times. I tried switching out cables (both DP and HDMI) - no difference. Same flicker. Then I connected to a different computer - still flickering! So it's definitely the monitor - not the cables and not the computer. I'm returning it - which is a shame because I otherwise like this monitor and need a good 27"" one - just without flicker! (Left it at 5 stars because I'm giving Dell the benefit of the doubt. I'm assuming I just got a dud. We'll see when I reorder . . . . )

This is a great everyday monitor - but the screen settings it ships with are very bland. When you first plug it in and connect it up, you'll get a mediocre image. Go into the screen settings using the little buttons hidden on the underside of the front right edge of the monitor. Play around with the different choices and adjust brightness, contrast, RGB, mode, etc. until you get the bright crisp image you want. That's what I did and I'm very happy with the results. Plus the stand is great. It raises, lowers, tilts and swivels. Connections are good too - offering both HDMI and DP ports. All this for $170 is a darn good deal. Just be sure to adjust the image in settings after you set it up.",26,"尺寸: 27.0"" FHDDisplay type: 高度可調零件料號: S2721HS"

Hicks,3.0,2022-05-20 00:00:00,美國,,"I measured the diagonal screen size and it's closer to 23 and a bit inches corner to corner. Nothing about this product is 27 inches. iruler.net, which detects your monitor and puts a real size ruler on the screen, says the monitor is 22.9"" but either way, it's not 27. And it's not the frame size vs viewable, on the top and sides there's maybe 3/16 of an inch of black frame outside the screen, and at the bottom maybe 5/8. But nothing that inflates a 23 inch monitor 4 inches so they can call it 27"" in the item description.

It is a perfectly good monitor from what I can tell, I just expected it to be 4 or 5 diagonal inches bigger than the old one I replaced and it's about the same size and resolution. Glad it was on sale. Feels like false advertising though.

[Follow-up] Gotta point out, on the box the monitor is packed in, it has a little plan-view of the monitor from the top, side and front, and the front view has a suggestive diagonal line with 27"" printed next to it A 27 inch diagonal monitor would literally not fit in the box. Dell is a pretty major brand, I'm still stumped by this false product claim that is refutable by anyone with a tape measure. You'd expect they would know someone might, you know...check. The only reason I'm not returning for a refund on principle is that they were on sale and they are ""big enough"" for my needs. The fact remains though, that from the Amazon ad to the shipping package, the dimensions of the product are bogus.",20,"尺寸: 27.0"" FHDDisplay type: 高度可調零件料號: S2721HS"

This Dell meets my expectations/requirements for performance/cost balance. The color fidelity is excellent and refresh rate is also excellent. Both are much more than satisfactory for my use case

The big negative for this monitor for me is that the resolution settings choices are severely limited. You get two or three default resolution setting choices and that's it! It is not possible to meaningfully decrease item display size by choosing a higher resolution (there are no useful higher resolution settings to choose from).

As a chemistry lecturer, i wanted a laptop for backup in case something happened to my desktop. My university is still work from home so being able to stay online is very important.
My final choice was between the M1 macbook pro and this but decided to go with the xps 13 because certain software I use doesn't work on mac.
The laptop is everything i wanted and then some. It's extremely quick, and adjusting windows 11 has been easy. The build is premium and the keyboard is superior. It wasn't too bogged down by bloatware (mainly antivirus which i quickly uninstalled).
The battery life is average thus far and the quality from the webcam is below average.

I was replacing my old ASUS 17 inch laptop and wanted to order reasonably high end specs, but even though the specs are higher end than my old system, it barely seems faster, and at times there are inordinate delays in responsiveness. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised at the short battery life of the system because there isn't much room to fit a battery in such a small package, and that actually isn't that big a problem since I mostly use the system at home and can reconnect to power whenever I need to, but its still disappointing. I seem to get 3-4 hours from a full charge. The really annoying issue is that the cooling fan seems to run noisily when I am barely doing anything with the system, and once it starts running it doesn't want to stop unless I turn the system off.

I absolutely love the XPS line. I have the 17, and it's a monster workhorse. It's the only laptop I have that can compare to my desktop. I wanted something a little smaller to easily carry around, and where battery life wasn't a concern. This was the obvious choice.

I'm using the Windows 11 version, and I'm very happy to report that it doesn't feel like a big leap from Windows 10. Almost everything on it is an intuitive transition. The only thing that was weird for me was the centralized taskbar, but I found that there's a setting to put it back on the bottom left like I like, so I'm happy.

The screen is as sharp and bright as I've come to expect from the XPS line. It's absolutely beautiful, and it makes watching YouTube feel like a clean experience. I really like the 16x10 aspect ratio as that extra space makes doing work and browsing web pages so much easier.

It uses WiFi6, and it automatically detected it from my router, so I'm running full WiFi 6 with no effort on my part. Pages open immediately, and everything feels very responsive. It feels like a solid Ethernet connection.

I used Crystal Disk Mark and I'm getting around 3 Gigs for both read and write. The hard drive is definitely no bottleneck.

It upgraded the laptop bios without me having to do anything special. That's really cool to me because low level security problems need to be taken care of, and most people can't do it. This literally did everything for me just by hitting Windows Update and then restarting the computer. In my opinion that makes this one of the best laptops for people that don't want to have to think about it.

I have to talk about the case. It's such a heavy duty feeling laptop just because of the thick aluminum case. Anyone that picks it up is surprised by the rock solid feeling on it.

The keys on it feel like a luxurious soft material that my fingers love touching. It's a beautiful typing experience. It's a 13"", so there's no numpad, but the keys aren't crunched together. I have big hands, so that's a big deal for me, and typing on this feels very natural.

The touchpad is just like my 17 in that it's the best touchpad on the market today. It's responsive, it registers exactly like I expect, it clicks when I press it, and it makes for a normal feeling experience. These are the only types of touchpads that don't frustrate me into grabbing an external mouse.

I tried Far Cry 6 on it just to see how it could handle gaming. I was getting artifacts, but I chalked that up to new game, new computer, new operating system. I expect a patch soon for it. I tried my favorite Far Cry title, Far Cry 4, and I could run that at 720 with 50 fps, or 1080 with 30 fps.

Overall this is a beautiful premium laptop that's fully capable of taking on my work.

Highly recommended.",4,

Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB LPDDR4x RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Windows 11 Pro, 2Yr OnSite, 6 months Dell Migrate – Silver

This Laptop Is stunning. It's sleek and is very well made. Summary is, we are very happy with this laptop despite Dell and their bloatware.

The XPX 9310 measures 0.58 by 11.6 by 7.8 inches and weighs just over 2.5 lbs. The display is 1,920/1,200-pixels and looks beautiful. It's not quite as vivid as Retina display but it's really close. The 16 by 10 aspect ratio feel really good on this size laptop. The XPS 13 has only to two USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 support. If you have a lot of stuff, you'll need a dock or hub. Performance is great and we have had zero issue with the CPU or Ram getting bogged down in Photoshop or blender. It's not as desktop so it's not as fast at rendering but does a pretty decent job keeping up with my 4 year old loaded out desktop.

My biggest beef is how difficult Dell makes it to remove the bloatware. Some of the software is stubborn, but some is pretty near impossible to get rid of. I tried doing a clean install from a usb drive and Dell blocked it. So, thanks Dell, you get one star off.",3,

Chan,4.0,2021-11-28 00:00:00,美國,,"The Dell XPS 13 9310 Thin and Light Touchscreen Laptop is a great option if you're looking for a fast, lightweight tablet/laptop combo that's perfect for taking while on the go. A touchscreen laptop is something I honestly thought was overrated until I tried it - having the work functionality of a laptop with the ease of navigation of a tablet, I found myself loving being able to type of my work then quickly tapping buttons and parts of the page on the screen without having to fuss with a mouse. The laptop has an excellent display, a fast processor, and boots up/shuts down amazingly quickly so I can wrap things up and easily take it on the go. It's so lightweight that I feel like I'm carrying a tablet, albeit one that comes with a keyboard built-in and closes like a flip phone to protect both the screen and the keyboard. It only has a few things about it I don't love, but for the most part, I would still purchase this laptop again simply because it gets our family's tasks done and done well.

The display is excellent and images come back very detailed while the touch screen works without any flaws. The picture quality is pretty amazing - it comes through very clearly with clearly defined details and I was able to watch Ytube videos in 1440p60 as well as 4K HD without any lag. As for the touch screen capabilities, it works as well as any other touchscreen device I've used. It's very responsive and many of the finger motions such as pinching open to zoom in/pinching in to zoom out are the same as most tablets and phones. One thing to note is that the screen does not rotate when the laptop is turned on its side nor can you fold the keyboard behind the screen - if you want that capability, there is a 2-in-1 version where you can do just that. As for using a stylus/pen, this laptop does not support the Dell Active Pen, but you can use normal passive pens for more precise taps on the screen. I personally found using my fingers was suitable enough, but like most tablets, I also found myself having to clean the screen more frequently than on my normal laptop.

The camera on the Dell XPS 13 9310 is absolute garbage. At not even a megapixel, everything recorded or photos taken with this laptop will look like photos taken on digital cameras from the 90s (and I would know, I owned a crappy digital camera in the 90s!). While it works well enough for a last-ditch work meeting under the proper very bright lighting, as any light dimmer than a spotlight on you will make you look as grainy as a face buried in the sand, you're probably better off using your cell phone for any important virtual calls.

Similarly, the speakers on the Dell XPS are only average at best, although I didn't test them very much since I like to use headphones with my mobile devices. With that in mind, headphones connect very well via Bluetooth, and if you want to use wired headphones, there is a headphone jack on this laptop. Speaking of inputs, there are relatively few connection points for peripherals – just two USB-C ports (one of that you will need at some point to charge the laptop), a microSD card reader, and a headphone jack. If you need to connect any other device via wired connection, you will need to get a USB-C Multiport Adapter. Luckily there are many available on Amazon and they work great with this computer.

The software on this computer works as well as any other Windows-based computer. There's the inevitable push to pay for McAfee Security and some general bloatware in there, but everything you don't want can be easily uninstalled and nothing really slows the computer down. The battery life on the Dell XPS is fairly good and I've been able to run it for several hours without needing to stop and charge it. Battery life does vary depending on many factors including how bright you turn your display on, what programs you're running, and if you're running peripherals on it (just for starters!), so your mileage will vary. I've found I had no problem running this computer for 6 hours before I plugged it in - it still had some charge left when I did so, and I've never tried to run it into the ground. Finally, one last thing to note is that the computer does run fairly hot. I'm not sure if this will be an issue in the long run, but this laptop runs hot enough where I don't want it sitting on my lap while working unless I'm in a cold doctor's office or a ski lodge near the door. So far it hasn't caused any adverse issues with my computer, it's still concerning and an inconvenience to put the laptop on a table or on a book while using on my lap.

Overall, the Dell XPS 13 9310 is a great quality computer that is very lightweight and great for travel. I like how portable it is, how quickly it runs, and the picture quality on the display. It's convenient to be able to use the screen like a tablet but have all the functionality of a standard laptop. While it's not perfect, it's still a good quality laptop that's worth considering.",3,

So far it hasn't caused any actual issues but, I do not see how it will survive getting this hot. It happens after about 20 minutes to half hour of use and just gets worse from there the longer you use it. Will update as needed.

It's a tough little thing that performs great in almost all areas - I don't do any kind of gaming or photo editing, so I can't comment on those areas, but for everything else it is great.

Case feels very solid, durable, and protective.

Still getting used to windows 11 even on my other laptops, but not a whole ton different. Not enough to make it feel like I don't know where anything is or what to do, so it isn't a huge transition if you've still been on a previous version.
Battery life is great. I've left it sit for a few days in a row on the same charge with using about 2-3 hrs a day for typical internet use before it warns me that battery is low.
Initial setup was pretty quick and very easy.
Not much to go in and delete/uninstall to save space. All was done in a few minutes.
No issues with wifi or bluetooth connections.
I haven't come across anything to complain about.
I'm picky with keyboards and how I want them to click/feel. I am happy with this keyboard. Feels good, not too clacky. Very smooth, but plastic-y.
Cord feels cheap for the device. It is very rigid. Plug looks and feels very generic and again very plastic-y. USB c charging on either side is a huge plus.",0,

I was happy with my laptop but after I got this I discovered that I was missing out on so much! Below, I will talk about the main points I always look for when I'm buying a laptop, and I hope you find them helpful.
- The laptop was very welled packaged. It came in a nice small all black box. The box contains the laptop, a charged and 2 USB C; one of them is thunderbolt 4 which is compatible with the most recent docking stations. You can also connect it with most monitor's using the thunderbolt 4. It also comes with a dongle from USB C to universal USB port; which you probably won't need with the most recent devices, but it's still helpful and good to have
- The charger is small; compact and light. Which makes it portable and good for travelling. The charger is USB C.
- The setup was very easy and convenient. It took less than 15 minutes to get the whole thing up and running. It was also very easy to migrate my files from my Dell G3 to this one.
- For the display, it's very bright full HD touchscreen. I'm usually not a fan of touchscreens on laptops cause I've had my experiences of ones who would take a look of charge and power from the laptop for the touchscreen to function; but with 16 GB DDR4 Ram; you will not face any issues. The screen functions very smoothly just like a tablet or a mobile device. The maximum resolution is 1920 x 1200. The beauty of the screen is that the black is VERY dark and the brightness outdoor was great. It's very comfortable for the eyes and VERY clear.
After using this for a while, I can tell that the most powerful piece about this laptop is the display screen.
- One of the nicest feature about it, is that the turnoff power is connected to the screen. After you shutdown, once you open the lid, the laptop will be turned back on. It takes only seconds to be turned on
- It has face recognition & finger print technology. You can use either technology to operate and they both work so smoothly and very convenient. You will still need to setup a pin even if you choose one of these technology.
- The laptop is super thin and light; it weighs around 2.8 pounds. I didn't realize how heavy my old laptop was until I got this. Usually, smaller/thinner laptops don't function as good; but this is a beast.
- Has Intel Iris XE graphic card which is decent. 2.00 GB shared dedicated memory. Obviously, this computer is not for gaming; as you can get everything in such a thin/small/ compatible laptop, however, you can still run some games on medium/low quality; such as The Witcher 3, Civilization 4 or similar games smoothly with 30 - 60 frames per second. Which is pretty good for dedicated graphic card. But, bear in mind that the laptop may get hot due to the processing power required for such games if you decided to use for gaming or for designing programs such as 3D max, Rivet and Autocade
If you want to turn this laptop into a gaming one, you can purchase a external graphic card with your required specifications.
- Sound quality is good. Loud and clear. and I think it's more than enough with a laptop with this size.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with this laptop; it's great for my needs. It's everything I was looking for in a laptop when it comes to size, weight, processor, display screen and I did read some negative comments about the camera, but this is not something that I'm concerned about at all, as I'm a type of person that keeps their cam OFF in meetings. So this is my least concern.

Do your research before buying a laptop at this price; but from my use and experience in laptops; this is really good and it's way better than expected. Worth every penny!

The FHD+ 1200p choice provides quite high enough pixel density for such a small display size and I believe it also helps with battery life more than with the optional 4k UHD+ display. This screen size gives an overall 16:10 aspect ratio providing more vertical space for more efficient work. The panel is non-reflective one, IPS equivalent “wide viewing angle” that has an efficient brightness level and is good for outdoor activities. Contrast and colors are very accurate. The screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz.

The power adaptor supports input voltage 110 – 240 which means it is universal and supports different types of electric volts worldwide.

This 11th Gen Dell laptop offers the ability to upgrade your SSD for up to 2 TB. I had 408 GB storage free out of the box. I did the SSD storage speed benchmark test (2 runs) using Crystaldiskmark 8.0.4. Results were around 2-2.5 Gbps for both read and write. These numbers are quite fast and you might not easily find a faster device, storage wise.

*My total all core render Cinebench R23 score is: 1ST pass: 3301 / 2nd pass: 3804 (average for this specific processor).
*3D Mark Score: 1240 (lower part of the curve among gaming laptops scores).

In short, this is a great business level laptop from Dell that I will choose for some color photography work and productivity. For more professional color-sensitive photography work, I’d definitely recommend the 4k or 3.5k optional upgrades. But, if you are a battery nerd like me, you may want to sacrifice some higher resolutions for a better overall battery life.

Recommendations?
Camera quality can be improved and it’ll be also great to see a camera shutter available in the future.",5,

The whole thing has a premium feel which is great in a world where so many laptops are all plastic. Aluminum plus a soft touch carbon fiber look is a win here. The screen has all the detail I want with plenty of brightness. Viewing angles are great so while this isn't exactly cinema size if you have someone else looking on they can see no matter where they are. Performance wise I've been able to get everything I needed done: Light gaming, browsing, high def video. No problem. For a laptop the keyboard is just fine. Not mechanical feeling but a crisp click nonetheless. Ports are a bit limited but I have to say I've gotten very used to only having USB-C and a headphone jack. They do provide a small dongle so if you will need something plugged in while you're out I find just keeping the dongle attached to whatever the device you're bringing is or keep it in a bag. The only real complaint I have is the battery life. Somewhat understandable in something with an i7 in it but don't expect to be out all day using it if you dont have somewhere to plug in. I don't find myself out like that too much so realistically it's not a problem but it does mean the battery is something you have to be conscious about. Beyond that it's a powerful, small, and well built laptop that can just be carried around like a small paper notebook. The compact size means I actually take it around with me as opposed to a 15"" that I only move if I have a specific purpose. It really is a sweet-spot in my opinion and I'd have no problem recommending this one to anyone.",2,

It has such a slim profile that it's sized like a small folder, so it's incredibly portable and easy to work on when traveling. The 13 inch screen in perfect when you need something bigger and easier to work/type on than a tablet, but don't want anything too big or bulky.

Comparing this to my Acer Spin 5, the actual screen viewable area seems to be larger. The bezel frame around the Acer is wider, so the super slim frame around the Dell offers even more screen viewing real-estate.

The touch screen is very responsive and I'm pleased they included a backlit keyboard. My Acer that's similar in style and design doesn't have a backlight, which has been an issue since the start. I never thought it would be a big deal, until I didn't have the backlight and I realized how difficult it can be to type in low light with black keys that have nothing to light them up.

One thing that's very different between the systems is how few ports this computer has. This Dell has just a single type C port and an SD card slot. My Acer Spin 5 has two type C ports, an HDMI, two USB ports and an SD slot. However my Acer is a tiny bit thicker than this Dell. So you sacrifice additional ports for having an ultra slim design. Something to keep in mind when deciding on a computer, since what you connect to this Dell will be limited.

The speakers sound quite good for such a small machine. The screen is bright and the colors are rich. The included graphics card has been able to run everything smoothly for me so far. While I don't game with this Dell, I do some video editing with it and the software has worked well without any lagging or crashing. About the only thing I could think of changing would be the inclusion of a single USB port, for use with some small wireless travel mice.",0,

CPU: Intel Core i7-1195G7 2.9GHz/ 5.0GHz boost 4 Core/8 Thread Processor
This is the latest 11th gen, 10nm chip for non-gaming portables. You get the increased power savings from shifting to 10nm process node. This is not an 'H' chip usually on gaming laptops but the G series for better heat and battery management.

RAM: 16GB DDR4 4267MHz Dual Channel
Plenty of RAM, even for Chrome, the faster clocked RAM is a nice plus.

NMVe: Micron 2300 NVMe 512GB M.2
The only replaceable part in this system. The rated R/W speeds are 3300/2700MBps. Uses Micron 96 Layer TLC NAND.

LCD: 13.4in 1920x1200 panel, 500 nits brightness
Dell has the brightest screens of any laptop brand. The FHD+ screen is much better for battery life than the 4K OLED screen. Text can be a bit small when viewed at 100% setting, you might need to bump to 125% or 150%. The touch screen was responsive and the sensitivity was good. 100% sRGB coverage but only 90% DCI P3.

VIDEO CARD: Intel Xe
Don't expect to play any recent AAA titles on anything higher than 720P. This is just barely faster than basic Intel UHD graphics. If you really want to game, this laptop is not meant for you.

WIFI: Killer 1650s WIFI 6
This is a rebadged Intel AX200, which in my opinion is a good thing. Killer makes placebo cards at best and even worse software. Do yourself a favor and uninstall all Killer software and watch your network issues disappear. Install the Intel AX200 drivers and you will be all set.

PROS

Windows 11 - There are some issues here that make any computer not as easy to work on. The taskbar for one (you cannot resize it, you cannot ungroup the icons, you cannot have smaller icons, it doesn't show the time on secondary monitors and you cannot move it.) Setting the default browser in Windows 11 is very difficult. You need to set your default under HTTP and HTTPS. Zero offline local accounts.

I have a MacBook Pro (several years old) that I use when I need mobility and I like it but it was time for a new laptop. I like to change them out before any issues arise and I loose every thing.
This dell has a nice feel to it and I like the feel of the keys. The screen is crisp and clear but dose have some bleeding around the edges.
The speed is superior to what I was using. I do a lot of CAD design work related to 3d printing and this can be too much for some computers but this dell handles it just fine.
I find the battery life is about what I would expect. It fluctuates with what I am doing but I can count on a good solid 4 hours before I need to charge it.
I wish the screen was bigger but that has to do with my budget (and eyes) not the computer.
My MacBook Pro was hot on the legs after about 20 minutes and this one is the same but that is to be expected when you think of all that is going on in there.
I try to not use any lap top on my lap for several reasons. First off It can't be good all of that electrical field held up to you're body. Second heat kills things. You're legs are a great insulator to hold in that heat and just cook things.
I like this Dell lap top and I can recommend it based on my needs. If the specs match you're needs then I think you will like it too.

Taylor,5.0,2021-12-08 00:00:00,美國,,"It's been many years since I allowed myself a new laptop, and as I usually go for a lightly used older model I'm fairly easy to please, and hardly the harshest critic of the most up to date technology.

That said, the moment I pulled this laptop from its box I was in love. At a little over 1KG it's incredibly light, though because it's less than 12"" wide and 8"" deep that weight is quite concentrated. It feels dense in a way that no laptop I've ever used has felt, a hint that lots of exciting technology has been crammed into this tiny package.

I don't do much intensive work day to day, but every few weeks I need to fire up Photoshop to do some fairly complex stuff that absolutely annihilates my old laptop. With 16GB of RAM and the Intel Iris Xe Graphics card this thing can stroll through the kind of work that would cause my old laptop to grind to a halt. What's more I can keep multiple processes working in the background while I work, so graphics work is no longer a grind.

If you're looking for a small and extremely portable laptop that can handle anything you can throw at it, the Dell XPS 13 9310 is an excellent candidate. Yes, it's expensive, and I'm sure you can get a laptop with similar specs in a slightly less portable package for less, but I've never used a laptop with this much power that's small enough to toss in a tote bag. My only slight complaint is that it runs a little hot when you start to push it, because the heat needs to go somewhere and there just isn't enough room to dissipate it effectively. It's not enough to knock this down from a 5 star review, though. Just buy a cooling pad or raise it off the surface.",0,

First of all I never had a laptop with touchscreen so I’m getting used to it a little bit considering I’m a mouse kind of person but it sure is handy when you don’t have one or when we will be flying.
Sizing is perfect for us because this is our household laptop and take with us traveling, it’s light, fits perfectly in my purse or hubbys backpack, sizing is super universal.
Everything I streamed so far have fabulous performance, very enjoyable clear picture and sound just right, again very useful in a car or plane for our son.
I’m technically behind I think so I couldn’t figure out how to plug in the mouse but there is adapter that comes with it from USB to C that you can utilize but we also have Bluetooth mouse that works perfectly with it.
Speed is fantastic, no lagging, just smooth and fast, I mean I can’t ask for better experience. I’m utilizing it with my office products for some work stuff and home, really we using it for multifunctional purposes because it just can handle it on, small but mighty!
It’s quite, I use it with no issues when my baby snoozing next to me but it tends to get a bit hot when using it proactively with multiple things running, I might look into cooking pad for it at some point but I really try not to use it too much in bed.

This is a really solid productivity ultrabook, with nice features that make it feel high end. It's designed to be lightweight, and push wireless connectivity. The largest issue I have with it however, is temperature management. To fully take advantage the capability of the CPU, this laptop needs some assistance with cooling.
TEMPS/COOLING
When pushing this laptops CPU (which is a great CPU) the temps get pretty high. I played Civ 6 on this PC which it could handle (see more about graphics below). But Civ can get pretty CPU heavy the farther into the game you get. I've got a screenshot here with temps and you can see it sometimes got as high as 95 C. At one point when playing and charging at the same time, the entire game crashed and the laptop rebooted – I have to assume this is about the temps so from then on I had to be more careful. I also use this laptop in bed and it'll make my bare legs red so it definitely needs a fully flat surface like a tea tray or something – ideally with a cooling pad.
POLISH/QUALITY OF LIFE FEATURES
There are a lot of quality of life features that I really enjoy. The fingerprint reader for sign-in is nice. I don't care for facial recognition in my technology for a lot of reasons so having the fingerprint option is great and it works very reliably. You can also add multiple fingers to it. The touchscreen is very responsive and accurate, being able to swipe to go back in a web browser for example, is really nice when just browsing. It is very thin and super light so it's portability is excellent. There are some Dell features that might be worth your time, they might not – an integration for using your cell phone with the computer is one of them. There is quite a bit of bloatware out of the box which is annoying. The charging cable has a light at the end so you know if it's plugged in which is a small thing, but adds to the polish of the product. Overall it feels like they tried to make a product that could compete with a macbook air and while I am not a macbook person, I do feel like where they landed was not as premium as a macbook air, but still a VERY good ultrabook.
IRIS XE
I also ran a timespy benchmark and my numbers were better than the other reviewers. I am not sure what on earth could be contributing to such disparate results. The Iris Xe is being marketed as integrated graphics that don't make compromises. While this isn't a gaming rig and I would never use it as such, if you are a gamer who travels and you want to be able to game on the road this might work if you temper your expectations. If you are a PC gamer you can also stream games to it from your gaming rig while sitting on the couch in another room so that's also an option, depending on the game. I have had a good experience so far, but I've also only tried games that I felt comfortable it could handle (like turn based games). I did try to push it and loaded up Valheim and was met with an atrocious 9-12 fps.
In addition to the integrated graphics, the other limiting factor here is, can you mitigate the heat? Because gaming is a battery drain, you'll be probably using it while plugged in, also while the CPU is cranked up. So a cooling pad is probably going to be necessary unless it's in short bursts like a 30 minute train ride for commuters.
PORTS
The I/O on here is super bare bones. Just two thunderbolt ports, an aux, and microSD. It IS nice to be able to charge from either side of the laptop. But because of the streamlined I/O and the fact that this is a productivity laptop first and foremost, you'll probably need a hub or docking station to make this usable in an office environment. I have been using a Bluetooth mouse and that's been very responsive so cutting cords with peripherals is an option but connecting to power and multiple screens will likely still require a dock.
STORAGE
To my knowledge the storage is not expandable but it is replaceable. So you could ostensibly upgrade to a larger NVME if you'd like but you're looking at migrating all your stuff and reinstalling windows etc. to do it. 512 GB is not a lot, however with increasing amounts of cloud storage being utilized, it might be find for a typical productivity user that doesn't focus on video or photo.
BEST POSSIBLE USE CASE
So who is this laptop for? I imagine it's for a commuting office worker first and foremost. The compact size is really only necessary if you will be moving it around. If you'll have it plugged in to a dock and mounted all day every single day, then I really don't see the point in accepting so few ports. Not being able to plug in even a USB flashdrive without an adapter (it does come with one) is a huge pain for some people, so the portability really needs to be worth it. Otherwise, I'd get another laptop with similar specs that has a better set of ports on the side. It IS forward thinking with the Thunderbolt ports though and as technology marches forward, we will see more accessories and peripherals that rely on USB C/Thunderbolt. Like I said, if you won't be traveling with this laptop or taking it home with you regularly, I'd suggest a slightly thicker, slightly heavier laptop with similar specs but that's just me. Overall, this is an excellent laptop. It performs very well for what it's made to do – which is primarily productivity work. The display is lovely, the touch screen is responsive. All the features work without having to fight to get them to. The camera is pretty terrible in low light, it's less atrocious when you're well lit. Also the bezel is so thin that I don't think it would be easy to find a shutter small enough to cover the camera and not block any part of the display.",0,

The battery runs so hot you can’t touch the laptop, it runs out very quickly, and the laptop expresses all the signs of overheating: slow processing and constant shut downs for no obvious reason. It is patently obviously a lemon.

It took about two months of hassling Dell before Dell acknowledged the problem.

It took another two months of constant texts with Dell support before they sent somebody to look at it.

The person they finally sent spent half a day at our house without fixing the problem. Now we are back to texting Dell trying to get them to replace our laptop.

Bottom line: Dell sold us a broken laptop and refuses to fix it.",5,

The touch screen display is responsive and worked with no issues. I found the overall image quality to be superb and the sound quality to be decent. The camera quality wasn't perfect, but was okay for me. I also liked how the main screen was uncluttered and just had the internet browser and recycle bin on it, with the rest of the buttons on the bottom of the screen.

I couldn't believe how small, light, and thin this laptop was when it arrived! It feels like it weighs less than an iPad but is a full laptop.

It starts very quickly and smoothly. It was quite easy to configure. It is incredible how easy it is to set up a new computer these days - I remember the immense hassle that used to follow in the wake of setup disks and making everything the way you like it... Now, with this Dell, it was super fast and easy to set everything to our existing settings.

Once the ubiquitous bloatware was removed there were no pop ups and smooth sailing. It is a very fast machine, although we are using it mainly for cloud-based activities, so have not stressed the hard drive much. We are quite pleased with it!",1,

It's not a gaming laptop, but you can play a lot of mid-spec games just fine. It's an awesome business device, and it can handle just about anything that would be considered ""heavy"" use at home.

I like my laptops on the small side. I was big into ""netbooks"" back in the day, and rarely aim for a screen size over 13 inches. More often than not those criteria mean that I'm stuck with something that's underpowered and underwhelming. Not so with this little beauty.

The processor, memory, etc. are all top notch, but you can see that from the listing. I'm guessing if you've read this far, you've probably done some research already on the ""hard"" specs, and now you want the more touchy-feely impressions.

So here goes: Getting it out of the box, everything screams quality, from the packaging itself to the shiny aluminum chassis to the slightly rubberized wrist area that helps hold your hands in position for typing. The screen goes almost edge to edge, with only about 1/2 cm lost to the bezel on each side. Turning it on for the first time was ridiculously fast, and even during setup everything felt snappy and responsive, whether I was using the keyboard and track pad or the touch screen. Both support all of the standard touch / pinch / etc. controls that we've all gotten used to. The touchscreen is responsive enough that I haven't fat-fingered anything on it yet, which happened often with some of my ""budget"" machines. Even better, the screen must be made of something that repels oils, since I haven't had to clean smudges off of it nearly as often as my last laptop (or my phone, for that matter).

On that subject, even on the highest battery optimization settings the screen is colorful and bright. Everything I've watched or done on it looks sharp and rich. That said, the screen doesn't angle back as much as I'm used to, so unless it's sitting on something on my lap, it can look a bit washed out unless I hold it at the right angle. That doesn't seem to be a problem from the sides, just from above. The sound is also surprisingly good for something this tiny. I listened to a few music videos on it at around half volume, and my wife could hear it clearly downstairs. I think they might even be louder and clearer than the ones on her gaming laptop.

Speaking of gaming, like I said, this isn't a gaming laptop, but the integrated Intel Iris graphics keep up surprisingly well for anything short of current gen AAA games. If you're playing within your specs, the image is sharp and clear, with no tearing or artifacting or anything else that would show the machine is falling behind. It also does a good job when used as a base machine hooked up to a larger monitor. Since I don't tend to do a lot of processor-heavy tasks like video editing, my other benchmark for use has been editing and slicing files for 3D printing. Files that took 30 or more seconds on my 4 year-old HP Elite Book with 8gb RAM and a core i5 processor take literally a few seconds on this Dell. My largest file of a dragon that took around 3 minutes before was done in less than 20 seconds.

Do keep in mind that this machine only has 2 ports for whatever you want to connect to it, one on each side. That said, they're both USB-C Thunderbolt ports, so a decent docking station can take care of any peripherals. Also, as a bonus, this means that you can plug the USB-C charger into either side, which solves one of my own annoyances with a lot of other machines. Maybe it's just me, but having the charger on the ""wrong"" side for however I'm sitting just throws me completely off, and I love not having to deal with it here. There's also a micro-SD reader for more memory, and a 3.5mm jack for headphones.

If I had to find anything to nit-pick, it would be the keyboard. The keys are nice and responsive, even though the travel is kind of shallow. But successfully making the bezel on the screen so small means the real estate available for the keyboard feels (to me at least) just a tiny bit cramped. I can still type my usual 70wpm, but I make a couple more errors than I do on a full keyboard, especially on any keys my pinkies hit. I also have to take an extra second when I need to use the 'delete' key (which I just did while typing ""delete"") because instead of being in the upper right corner like on most laptops, it's one key in from that. The upper right corner is the power key, which has caused me a headache or two when typing too fast. They wisely made that key just a bit ""stiffer"" than the rest, so a casual press won't shut off whatever you're doing, but I've still managed it a few times in around a week of use.

Battery life is good, even when I turned off all the battery saver options. I've used it unplugged for 4-ish hours and still had more than 1/3 battery life left. Heat management is also good; it gets warm on my lap after 30 minutes or so, but it's never been uncomfortably hot. Wi-Fi 6 is amazing if you have a router that can keep up with it. Even graphics-heavy pages load in blink-and-you'll-miss-it times.

So again, this machine is just awesome for anything but hardcore gaming. The price is an investment in a no-hassle everyday experience, with several perks thrown in. You won't be disappointed.",0,

And it's a great looking laptop w/great specs. Build quality seems excellent. The screen is both bright and responsive. The keyboard feels good, although it has a slightly lighter touch than I prefer.

But...

It runs extremely hot, both on the surface and underside of the computer. You wouldn't want to use it on your lap or sitting on your chest, which by the way, is exactly how I often use it.

My MacBook Air with the M1 chip blows it away. Not sure which has better performance specs, but the MacBook Air has no fan, doesn't get hot, and takes everything you throw at it.

With the MacBook Air, you may get 14 or 15 hours of battery life out of it, with this Windows-based ""state of the art"" laptop, you might be lucky to get 3-4 hours.

And the MacBook Air was almost 50% cheaper than the Windows-based laptop ($899 vs. $1,700).

If you're in the market for a laptop and don't need to necessarily run Windows, the choice is clear. Otherwise, other than the issues mentioned, it's a perfectly fine computer and it's quite gorgeous. Is it worth the current asking price? Not in my view. 3 star rated.",2,

Packaging was better than expected. Included was cheap mouse, cheap keyboard, tiny usb 2.0 802.11n wifi dongle and a brand new Dell 65w adapter.

Not going to complain about the mouse or keyboard, never planned to use them.

Easy to replace the sata SSD, m.2 NVME SSD and two DDR4 RAM. Only one knob screw to remove the cover by hand. One disappointment is there is no screw mount to hold the end of the NVME SSD. It ends right where the mainboard is affixed to the case with a screw. There is an extra M.2 connection for wifi/BT module (no built-in antennae). USB 3 ports transfer speed meets specs.

The unit is great for office work, browsing, watching media. It can even run PS2 emulator at 30-50 fps on most games with default settings but it gets hot quick. If you're going to do light gaming in a warm area, be sure to use a desktop fan to force air circulation. I'm in Philippines where we mostly use fans not air conditioning, ambient temps about 80f.

Was going to install Linux, but it works so well with a debloated Windows 10. Why fix it if it aint broke?",3,尺寸: Manufacturer Refurbished樣式: Micro Tower | 256 GB SSD | 8G Ram | I5

The machines came as advertised, or at least as I expected them. Three had some damage to the connector for the wireless antenna. I could probably work it a bit to get them on anyway, but these are all using wired connections in my environment anyway. Some have noticeable fan noise, but some of the new models have this when you get in the micro form factor. The only truly disappointing thing about this purchase is the fact that every single one of them shipped with a defective power adapter.

I have spent several hours trying some way around it, but I've settled on postponing the hardware upgrade until the new adapters arrive. This is partially Dell's fault, to be fair. There is a chip in each adapter that ""talks"" to the machine and verify's that it's OEM and sending the correct voltage. If that communication fails (and old ones even if they're OEM often do), then the CPU will drastically underclock every time it boots. I know whoever refurbished these is aware of it because they intentionally disabled the warning that shows on POST in each of them. Resetting BIOS to factory settings made it start popping up again.

If you get one of these and aren't willing or able to buy a new adapter, there is a workaround I've found that won't work in a business environment well, but might suit you. Download ThrottleStop. Then from an admin account, create a scheduled task to launch the executable on any user login. That will bypass the CPU underclock, but it won't help things that take place before the first login (like Windows feature updates for example).

Another time I might be more lenient and give it higher than two stars, with all things considered. But I just finished wasting several hours on this trying to get these rolled out to a remote location... I'm more than a little miffed about it at the moment.",23,尺寸: Manufacturer Refurbished樣式: Micro Tower | 256 GB SSD | 8G Ram | I5

Runned a dell system upgrade tool, updated drivers and BIOS and nothing about getting the clocks back to 2.7ghz. Turns out, this issue is caused by 1- bad ac adapter 2- bad ac plug 3- motherboard/bios. Did some research and dell has some things going on with those small form factor pcs. Tested 02 ac power adapters from my old dell laptop and same problem. Did a bios reset and same issue. Checked bios alert history and it seems this has been happening since 2020.

After several attempts to reach the seller both through the Amazon message center and the email provided on his customer profile page the seller never responded. I filed a claim against the seller. Amazon even gave him a 48hr time to respond to them in which he did not, I gave him an additional 48hrs, still no response so a refund was requested, he magically appeared and requested me drop the request and guess what AGAIN he wanted us to fix his faulty product. He then proceeded to tell Amazon he would replace the item not mentioning to them it was only the part he wanted to replace that we have already replaced 2Xs he wanted to send us... not and entire functioning unit. I appealed the claim as I felt he lied to Amazon to get them to drop the request. Then he appeals stating it is out of the return/refund window. IF HE HAD DONE THE RIGHT THING ON DECEMBER 5th it would not have been. He gives Amazon a tracking # around February 5th for the part he wants us to replace for a 3rd attempt and guess what it is now February 21st and the tracking shows it has not even shipped. He claims it is because he is moving offices...I am too and my customers are still my priority. I have again appealed the claim and hope the seller does what is morally and ethically right as a seller and just give us a refund so we can purchase a functioning unit.",2,樣式: 桌上型電腦

Dislike
- Faulty power adapter plug, had to use my own Dell laptop adapter to power the PC.
- No built in wifi.
- Requires Ethernet to startup/setup
- No bluetooth, had to use the given keyboard with stucked keys rather than my own BT keyboard/mouse. I had to order a bluetooth adapter just for this.

Anyway I am too far to do any exchanges (additional cost involved) so just use the overseas shipping fees to get new replacement items would be more cost effective for me. Just hope seller thoroughly check their items and make sure its working before sending for consignment with Amazon.

Not a significantly different machine, though I was looking to have a USB-C on all of the machines I upgraded. The biggest concern was the tape over the model number, which looks like an overt attempt to mislead. Next time I buy systems I'll make sure they aren't sold by TekRefurbs...",4,樣式: 桌上型電腦

It works great for that.

The unit I received was clean inside and out, and well packaged with a Dell 130 watt power supply and a new-in-box Logitech wired keyboard and mouse set. The processor in this machine was an i7-6700. The internal drive was a Lexar 2.5"" SATA 256GB SSD with a fresh Windows 10 Pro on it. The 16GB RAM was a matched set of SK-Hynix DDR4-2133 modules. (I believe that this motherboard will use 2400 speed RAM, but this is good enough for what I'm using it for.) There was no internal WiFi or Bluetooth in the computer but they sent a no-name USB Adapter that says ""600Mbps 802.11ac"" with it. I haven't tried the adapter since I just plugged this machine into an ethernet hub.

It would have been nice to have an m.2 SSD and the higher speed RAM, as well as the built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, but this does come with everything that the description says it does and it's working well so far.

I did notice that the CPU temperatures were running higher than I like, about 60C-70C during low usage (pretty much idling), so I pulled the heat sink and found the thermal past to be a little dry. After replacing it the temps are now about 30C idling and 55C-60C during moderate usage.

This thing has a 210W power supply and 2 USB-C charging cables that are lined up perfectly to plug into my laptop. It appears to be working great so far and there is absolutely no degradation in performance due to lack of power. The power supply is huge, so be prepared if you're concerned about space/clutter.

Murphy,5.0,2021-12-07 00:00:00,美國,,"Great docking station. Photos of the item do not reveal the dual USB-C cables it contains to connect it to the laptop.

This docking station has a thick cable coming out of it that ends in a dual USB-C connector. I guess it needs this so that it can deliver the maximum power this laptop requires (I think max power over a single USB-C is 100W). The dual USB-C connector is unique in that the two connectors are keyed to fit together and held there with a magnet. So, if you want, you can separate the two connectors and plug just one in. This might come in handy if you have a different laptop you'd like to connect to this dock, but it has only one USB-C connector (and lower power requirements than the 7440).

This is a unique docking station, and I use it practically daily. I'm running two 4K-60Hz monitors and numerous USB-A peripherals from this docking station with no problems whatsoever.

If you need a dock for your Dell Precision laptop, consider this one - it's great!",3,

Second, and worse, is that if I use the dock with an HDMI monitor and try to screen share with Zoom, it causes the screen to flash on and off wildly until the port completely disconnects from the computer (with the usual sound). Last time I had to completely reboot my Precision laptop AND cut power to the dock to get my monitor working again. (Tried reboot first, no cigar. Had to do both.) I was trying to present on Zoom and that wasn't a good outcome. Since then I plug my HDMI monitor into the laptop port, that works, but nullifies some of the reason for shelling out big bucks for the dock.

It's pretty easy to nudge one and have it come disconnected. You also need about 4-5 inches of space next to the laptop to fit these cables. they do not bend and if you push them it's easy to come disconnected. I had to order a second USB dock to attach to this dock to get more ports. Also had to order a USB->3.5mm headphone adapter because this doesn't have 3.5mm output or input.

Pros - this can provide a LOT of power and support 3 monitors

Cons - Dock is large. Power brick is gigantic. only has 3 usbA ports and 2 USBC ports. Portable is not a word i would use to describe this.

My old laptop had a dock that it snapped into and provided power and more ports. I wish this was setup like that and just used the 2 USBC ports to attach. This would also lift the laptop since mine seems to have pretty limited airflow under it.

It was a $249 special, so it is what it is. I had the hard drive replaced 6 months ago with a more powerful, faster hard drive and it's been working great. Then about a month ago the battery stopped charging, and I was getting the error message ""AC adaptor/charger not recognized."" ??? I had to plug in the laptop to use it. I did some online research and this seemed to be a common issue for Dells, but I couldn't find anyone offering a winning resolution. So I purchased a universal battery for $25 and replaced it. Still didn't charge. Then I purchased a DELL AC adaptor/charger for $20. Still not charging. Then I purchased this DC power jack charging port cable for $7 and replaced it. BAM! LIKE NEW! Not sure if I needed all three, but after pricing new laptops it was well worth the $50 and all 3 items were very easy to replace. Nice tight ""click"" fit with the charger male into the DC adaptor port female. The battery charges quickly and lasts much longer than the original. Hope this helps.",1,

I also bought a new charger and a new battery. I'm currently making this review on the very laptop that quit working but is back up and performing just like new for about $65.00 instead of spending $1k for a new model. Ok, I probably didn't need the new battery but I figured if the case is cracked open, might as well update the power as well. Hope this helps someone who is concerned about getting into the guts of their computer, and no, it's not that difficult. You may have to purchase a small, quality screwdriver and invest in a plastic pry tool to help open the case but it's pretty easy to do the cable replacement. Good luck!",0,

Pros: Top tier Sony lens and CCD, the build is tight and modern looking, Windows software is much better than others have commented. Comes with additional desktop/shelf stand.

Cons: Long camera that does stick out in front of monitor a slight bit, like all add-on monitor cameras its not secured to monitor and can easily be knocked off. Some will not like that it doesn't have a mic, but I opted for an external dock with speaker and mic, so not big deal for me. Plus no webcam that sits on the monitor have speakers that are usable so you still need a speaker solution and all conference solutions have multiple noise cancelling mics in addition to speakers anyway. It also does not rotate, only up and down, but not many do. With AI face focus on this doesn't impact me as it follows my face. And lastly, of course it is pricey.

Summary: I wouldn't be surprised if Sony builds this for Dell as all the components are Sony inside. I found setup and use of the camera on Windows to be straight forward and had no issues. I see most of the negative reviews about the Dell software are Apple users. What did they expect buying from a retailer/manufacturer that is a competitor of Apple? Of course Dell isn't going to put as much effort into the Mac software/drivers. I found the AI face tracking to work perfectly. There is even settings for jump, slow or fast. Jump means it jumps without any motion. Obviously slow or fast mean it moves to your face. I use fast and find it seems most natural and least disruptive to viewers. I work in a low light environment or high light if I open the shades. The camera adjusts well to either situation. I couldn't ask for more. The camera runs only slightly warm for me, I had to touch for a little while to even notice it was above room temperature. It's possible others have gotten bad units and/or the manufacturer has resolved the issue since, or maybe I'm just lucky? Part of me thinks its just Logitech fans being hatters. LOL",0,

I'm pretty impressed with this cam overall and feel like I was blessed to know about it, (Hello) which you can find many reviews on.

I was a little worried it was dell when I purchased it. I never had good Dell experience, but the reviews are good.

Then my fears were confirmed as I started using it. Inside this very pretty exterior is trash dell software. It's supposed to be 4k, but the picture is always grainy, no matter what lighting. there doesn't seem to be a specific way to force resolution, and I tried the many setting with the required software but to no avail.

I also used it on my mac, with the same picture issue. So it's just a problem with the camera.

If anyone is interested, I ended up with Elgato, the rectangular front want. it's not as beautiful, but my picture is so good I tend to stare at myself on screen. Who is that handsome man?!",7,

Easily the most beautiful webcam in some time. Camera quality is also very good. My only qualm is Dell does not from what I can tell specify what features require windows and which do not. It’s basically a dumb webcam with zero configurability or features like AI auto framing when used on Mac OS. The lack of this detail in descriptions leaves you to assume there is either Mac software or that the processing for these takes place on the hardware. It does not. All features are present and work very well on my PC but I primarily bought it for use with my Mac for work calls.

So if you intended to use the AI auto framing or dive deep into configuration and wanted to use it with Mac OS you should probably look elsewhere.

If you are intending to use it with Windows I don’t think there is a better option unless you need a built in mic. The lack of one to me is a feature though as I value privacy.

If you are using a Mac and don’t care about the smart features, the design and quality overall is really great but it is pretty pricy without those features in the mix.",24,

I tried on two other computers and got the same results. Either this cam is defective or needs a firmware upgrade. For 200$ I expect flawless 60fps at 1080.

The second worked. I updated the software and the firmware, but the picture was terrible. It was grainy, washed out, and pixellated at any resolution. I couldn't get a good picture with the auto focus or by trying to focus it myself. I tried changing the settings in the Dell peripheral app, and using OBS, but I couldn't find any settings that looked good. With auto exposure on, the picture was way to bright. Turn it off and the picture becomes way too dark. It could just be the model I got, but it looks like this camera isn't ready to be sold. We have a Brio and an old C920.

Enabling the autoframing mode simply switches the camera to the wide (90 degree) field of view and zooms all the way out. It does not give you the option to zoom in on your face, and it does not track your face.

Dell support is predictably completely useless.

My guess is that this feature is not yet actually enabled in software. They are shipping the product missing primary functionality because, hey, that's what you do in 2021.

If Dell can be bothered to reach out to me and explain how to enable this feature and make it work then I will update my review.",35,

You are impressed right away with the weight and engineering of the camera. When it comes to value, this camera fully delivers at this price point.

Tips on software settings: You will want to turn off auto focus with the Dell Peripheral Manager. Otherwise it will adjust focus at times when you don't want it to. Also, change the quality setting to 4K UHD if you have software like OBS that can benefit from it. A personal preference of mine is to use the Smooth preset instead of Default because everything is ""warmer"" and more natural.

Most important tip: Get your lighting right. Cameras do so much better when your background is well lit as well as your face/body. I upgraded the ceiling light and got the ""Unicucp 2 Packs 96 LED Dimmable 2400-6800K 97 CRI Video Light"" set. If you already have a great webcam (such as the Logitech C920S HD Pro that I upgraded from), you are arguably better off investing in your lighting than buying this camera.

Happy with this purchase! When I do a before/after comparison with my old webcam and old setup, it's a massive difference.",2,

Can't believe I hesitated but there is a lot of cool shit you can get for the same price and it's just a camera, but this is super nice: Very wide field of view and the image is crisp, professional. I do hundreds of legal proceedings every month on Zoom and I can tell you, whatever you look like, whatever your house looks like, you will look in an entirely different class of human being than literally everyone else, if you have this camera. The build quality is actually really fabulous. I wasn't surprised, because I have an XPS13, but it really has some touches. And the software does too. You plug it in, it asks you what you want your default filter to be, it shows you as adjusts the camera and it's super slick, and that's it. It has motion features which I think will be useful, most importantly how it supposedly follows you when you're moving about. Not huge for a Zoom meet but if you are doing a real presentation and the camera does in fact pan like that while you are looking for something then it really will be worth the price of that alone, just making you look good while you're fumbling around.

We needed an inexpensive desktop computer pre-loaded with Windows for my wife to use. Basically for email, surfing, playing simple games (solitaire) and shopping. Not demeaning my wife, it's just what she uses her computer for. This one was a good price. I've been a computer programmer for years and I know that I didn't need a brand new, top of the line, super-fast, computer for what this one's purpose would be, so I went with a refurbished one.

I did not need new monitors, which led to my only problem. My existing monitor cables were DVI style and this pc tower has ports for HDMI and VGA cables. A quick trip to Wally-World for VGA cables and I was good to go. This unit also had an extra slot and connectors for a second hard-drive, which I used to attach the hard-drive from our old computer. This made it easy to transfer pics and files from the old drive to the new one.

I’m assuming that it wasn’t turning on due to it being without power for so long. It probably just needed some time to gain enough power to turn on again. Other than that, the computer is super fast and surprisingly VERY great for the price!! It was very easy to setup Windows, and I love the changing colors!! The only other complaint I have is that the WiFi adapter that came in the box is kinda slow and has connection issues, I’d suggest getting a different one on Amazon.

The computer worked immediately, and with no issues. So far I’ve added a USB WiFi adapter, and have a BlueTooth dongle arriving tomorrow. The bios is from 2014 - so the computer probably wasn’t built earlier than that - and along its life it picked up some dust in the “cup holder” and the case showed the external wear expected of a 5-year-old device in institutional use. A quick look inside didn’t cause me any reason to look any further.

I’ve purchased remanufactured electronic components several times - and have usually been happy. Some were touted as having no external blemishes - and they didn’t. Those that were advertised as having some wear-and-tear (as in this one) did affect my purchase decision - but it eliminated surprises.

Back on the computer: I immediately hid it under a shelf (it’s running my Amateur Radio station) - so the little blemishes are of zero consequence.

So, in summary - It works. It was close to what I wanted to spend. It was received in perfect shape. And it came with Windows 10 Pro.

Five Stars!

11 Month Update 6/2021:

I love this computer. It boots up and shuts down very quickly (around 30 seconds each way?). Mine came with an i5-4590 3.3 (instead of the 4570 3.2) processor. I just this week updated the 2014 BIOS to Dell's A25 5/30/2019 (per Dell's web driver scan/update) which suggests to me that the SMBIOS version 2.7 and the 2019 BIOS will give me another few years of update utility. Dell's online driver support is very satisfying.

I bought this as an el-cheapo ($290) replacement for an expensive/aged ($3,400/10 year old) Lenovo laptop (Core2 Duo - CTO T61p ThinkPad), and at less than 10% of the Lenovo's cost, this thing is much better at what little I've thrown at it thus far (except for portability). And it's quiet, runs cool, and my new 510 watt CyberPower SX950U UPS reports that it consumes about 31 watts (41 with the monitor) when it's idling -- and for short bursts of demand, around 91~95 watts (computer and monitor) - so my UPS is more than up to the task of keeping things alive until the generator spools up.

Update 7/18/21: I just updated the video driver (per Dell's very-helpful website) - just 'cuz. And I've also added a Phillips 27"" 4K monitor -- and it (computer/monitor) works Great (although 27"" is not ""too big""). Despite the computer's birthday of 2014, it isn't showing to be long-in-the-tooth yet -- which makes me very happy.

Oh, and I sent back the CyberPower UPS (due to a weird issue - RFI sensitivity - and less-than-useful tech support) in favor of an APC BN1350M2 (810 watts) UPS -- which I rate Five Star.",5,樣式: USB 鍵盤滑鼠套件

It took me phone calls and emails and chats to Google, (who could not figure it out,) to a phone call with the Canadian company who refurbished it (who wanted me to send it back to Amazon,) to a phone call with Amazon, who wanted me to send it back for a refund, until finally I was able to find the parent company of Advanced Analytics, who after an email and 2 phone calls, solved the problem for me, by contacting their client (the computer's previous owner,) and asked them to remove the block on the extension for that computer. Which they did writing within a couple of days! The computer is lightening fast and fun to use. I'm very happy with it now. I would suggest, if you buy one and find this file extension installs when you put Chrome on there, find ""Global Analytics"" online and give them a call. They're very friendly and helpful.",27,樣式: RGB 黑色 16G

I then ordered a Dell 9020 SFF, Abys Electronics did the renewal , and the difference was very noticeable. This unit had no blemishes on the case and it actually looked polished to a brand new luster. The new and boxed keyboard and mouse looked perfect and operated perfectly as well. Unlike the earlier unit, which I emphasize did NOT come from Abys Electronics, this unit was a delight to use. Windows 10 came up in a flash and the video was perfect. I installed my favorite office suite program. The PC did not come with WiFi installed, as expected, because it was not mentioned in the listing. I have a WiFi dongle with antenna arriving tomorrow.

I knew the Optiplex series were built for a business environment with better components than a consumer machine. The computer arrived in a single box cradled in foam spacers and wrapped in a recycled plastic bag. The supplied keyboard and mouse were cheap, but I already had better on hand. Note...this machine has VGA and Dual Displayport outputs, so there was a bit of digging to find a DP to DVI cable in my stocks. Initial boot from the 500GB SSD was fast and smooth, as was setup. The Windows 10PRO activation went without a hitch, something you can be burned on if you go too cheap from a reseller. There was a very minor ding in the plastic face of the DVD drive. This model has a generous layout of USB ports, with both 2.0 and 3.0 front and back. The supplied Wi-Fi dongle is VERY flimsy, I had a bad moment when it came apart on me while I was changing USB ports. However once I snapped it back together and seated it, all was well. The primary use for this machine was for my Amateur Radio operations, and it serves the purpose. The 16GB of RAM lets me have several applications running at once. This is not a game machine, and the small form factor and power supply won't fit a fancy GPU, but performance wise, the quad core i5 is up to most tasks and videos run smoothly. It was nice to find a old school serial DB9 port on the back when a lot of old ham radio gear uses that connection still. All in all, considering the cost of a new 10Pro License, this workhorse PC gives solid bang for the buck when you don't need latest/greatest.

From the Dell site: ""When ordering an OptiPlex 3020 / 9020 Micro system, you have the option of including the Intel Dual Band 7260 802.11AC w/Bluetooth wireless networking kit (wireless card, mounting bracket, cables and antenna) in the system....
!! Factory Wireless Kit cannot be added to system after purchase. !!
If the wireless networking option was not selected at the time of purchase, then the factory kit cannot be installed after purchase because the mounting hardware is not available for sale after system purchase to install the wireless card.""

If the Optiplex 9020 you buy does not include wifi, I'm not sure how much work it is to get this going. You probably won't be able to know if you got the wifi version until you turn the box on. As I said above, the description claims Wifi is included (but it wasn't). View ""Device manager/network adaptors"" if there is no wifi listed there then the box does not support wifi.

I design and create wood art in the form of cornhole boards, wood flags, mosaics, etc. I have been wanting a desktop computer for quite some time so I don't have to keep transporting my laptop around the house. So now I have two work stations. First of all, I did a lot of research into different computers and I could not argue with the price vs the operating power of this machine, which is amazing. I ordered this computer the first time around and it came in quickly! However, I plugged the computer in and it power cycled continuously, in other words it did not work. The keyboard and mouse that came along with it were cheap and the right click only lasted one click and then stuck (I was testing the product). I did an exchange immediately with amazon (for entire product), which they fulfilled and shipped out a new product even before I returned the old one. Excellent customer service as always!

The second computer came in within the week! Even during this pandemic! I plugged it in immediately (as I was little excited), the computer fired up properly and is lightning fast! I am impressed with the product at this time! If there are any issues I will update this review! Also, my recommendation is to buy your own keyboard and mouse. The new one I received work ok, but I had already ordered nicer products, as the ones that come with it are cheap.
Do not be scared of a renewed product! Amazon guarantees them! If you are worried about a hard drive issue, then buy an external hard drive. They are not very expensive. I had no problem with the product exchange as I do realize it is a renewed computer and there is the risk of issues.",12,樣式: USB 鍵盤滑鼠套件

We don't use it for gaming, just simple word processing/presentation creation and Internet browsing. The one we had was dying; looooong load times indicated that either the motherboard or (more likely) the hard drive was reaching the end of its life (10 year old computer). I considered a new, high speed desktop with a separate graphics card and all the bells and whistles, but I already have a laptop for that. All I needed was a basic computer, so that's what I bought.

This computer arrived on time, and it was nicely packaged to ensure it didn't get damaged in transit. I don't know how old this computer is, but the condition of the case looked brand new. I removed the cover to look at the guts, and there were no signs of any dust or previous use. Don't panic if you don't see a power cord. The cord is in the nicely packaged keyboard box, along with the keyboard (duh!) and a wireless dongle. Lots of USB ports on this baby (10!), but it also has a few legacy ports like serial, PS/2, and VGA.

Set-up was easy. If you've never had a computer with a SSD hard drive, you will be amazed at how fast it is. Remember, this isn't a gaming computer, but it still boots and loads much faster than a ""traditional"" computer. The refurb company didn't load any bloatware on the computer, just good ole Windows 10. The only prompt to purchase anything additional was the expected Office 365 prompts.

So far, (this is day 3) this little computer is doing exactly what I purchased it for. For that reason, it gets a 5 due to 1) cost, 2) appearance, 3) no bloatware, and 4) operates as expected.",2,樣式: USB 鍵盤滑鼠套件

It comes with a very cheap corded keyboard and mouse and nothing else, so you will need to get your own monitor. It's small enough to put on the floor under your desk if necessary, and it's FAST! Setup was very simple and easy to navigate, but have all your various Microsoft credentials handy as you will need them multiple times.

There are several USB ports on the front and back and a CD drive which is a bonus since we occasionally have the need to view odd media like photos or a DVD of our kid's play that only come on a disk. Our son uses this PC to play Roblox, a very CPU-hungry game, with no issues. One thing I do not like is that the keyboard is very lightweight and has no rubber pads on the bottom, so it will slide around while you type unless you put something hard in front of it. We are using a wireless keyboard, wireless optical mouse, USB Snowball condenser mic, Logitech webcam, and a Google Home speaker with ours. Comes with various video outputs on the back as well. The computer does not come with WiFi or Bluetooth, but dongles for both are readily available and work well of you don't want to or can't LAN it to your router.

This unit arrived in a state that prevented me from setting it up for my personal use. I contacted the seller, and they walked me through several different processes in an attempt to allow me to log in. After a couple of days back and forth, and needing to buy a new flash drive in order to download Windows and reinstall it on the unit, I was finally able to use the computer.

After installing all of my personal files and settings, I went to use the disc drive to install software for my home business (which I'd already missed almost a week's worth of work getting the PC up and running), and found that the tray won't open. It does not respond to either the button nor the UI prompt. It doesn't even appear to be hooked up inside the tower as I hear no mechanical sound when trying to open it.

I again contacted the seller, who offered to send me a replacement drive I could install myself. Problem is, I can't install it myself and I don't feel like compromising the unit futher by tearing it apart. Buying an external drive or having a replacement installed will cost me extra, on top of what I've already spent/lost with the unit malfunctioning. The seller then offered me a partial refund of $12.

Needless to say, this was an insulting offer. I feel I was very reasonable and patient with the software obstacles, but I've been delivered a unit that was supposed to be guaranteed refurbished and it clearly was not sent through Quality Assurance to verify it would work for the person who purchased it.

Thankfully, Amazon has rectified the issue by offering me a promotional voucher for a more reasonable amount. The seller stopped responding to my messages after I expressed my displeasure with their offer.

There is NO WIFI adapter; thankfully, I had a TP-Link USB wifi adapter lying around, and it was easy enough to put that in. The other thing is that it does NOT have a HDMI output.

I don't game, so that entire topic is irrelevant to me and those in the higher levels shouldn't be looking at computers in this price range, anyway.

I will start with my only complaint: The seller doesn't tell you that the WiFi is via a dongle that goes in a USB port. I was wondering what it was for when inside the box with the wired keyboard and wired mouse, the little gadget was sitting, with no indication of what it was.

When I first fired up this computer, and started to set up Windows, it only showed an Ethernet adaptor and no WiFi. After scratching my head for a couple of minutes, I remembered the dongle and plugged it into a USB port. Success!

This little desktop has a lot to offer: a 64-bit version of W10 Pro, 32GB of RAM, dual DisplayPort video ports, lots and lots of USB ports, a DVD R/W and 512GB SSD. You will need to get inexpensive HDMI adaptors if your monitors won't work with DisplayPort. That was about $15 to take care of that.

Everything came up perfectly (once I connected the WiFi dongle) and I was in business.

1. Case was damaged with a dent in top and the Dell Logo missing from front
2. Description stated 512GB SSD - Product has 480GB SSD. BIG DISCREPANCY!!!
I should get a partial refund. I will keep the product but this is NOT GOOD.
3. The keyboard and mouse that were provided are VERY CHEAP/LOW QUALITY products. I DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO LAST LIKE OEM PRODUCTS.

Good points:
1. Good price for the system.
2. Arrived on time and in ""reasonable"" condition. SEE ABOVE. Damage does not appear to be from shipping. The Dell logo from the front of the computer was not broken off in transit. It was not in the box.

Please provide the TRUE country of origin fo this computer.. Is this a Chinese knock-off that you refurbished to ""current standards""? I know it is an obsolete model, no longer produced by Dell. However, I would like to know if it was a US surplus, returned product, 3rd party copy, etc.

This old thing is still working but takes over 15 minutes to boot and is definitely struggling to keep up eventually working painfully slow, we couldn't take this any more. We only use our household computer for online shopping, booking flights, simple Word documents and other simple tasks. We are in our fifties and don't do gaming. We needed a desktop PC again because we need a port for our printer to print receipts, flight tickets, boarding passes, etc.
This new PC arrived today, setup was less than 10 minutes and it boots and works lightning fast. We are so happy! I am sure this PC will last us for the next 20 years :-)",8,樣式: USB 鍵盤滑鼠套件

The ram and ssd and cpu while outdated by today's standards will be enough for anyone who isn't either gaming or video editing. The real question is how long will this device last before a component brakes or it slows down. If I can get 2-3 years I will be happy enough (not I did not by the warranty) .

Here are some buyer warnings:

1. There is NO WIFI CARD! I was stupid and didn't notice this when I bought the product. I am buying a usb wifi adapter, but for now I am rocking a supper long Ethernet cable until it arrives. Please plan on buying a wifi card/adapter along with the product if you want that capability (they are fairly inexpensive).
2. The included windows 10 doesn't recognize the headphones I plug into the headphone jack. Note that this is a windows 10 issue. I have configured my pc to dual boot with linux and on linux I do not have this issue.
3. These are 2.0 usb ports. This means that data rates are slower and may be incompatible with some modern devices.

hope this helps.",1,樣式: USB 鍵盤滑鼠套件

The last 6 months I spent trying to replace the Dell with a Surfacebook 2, a couple HP Spectre X360's, and a couple Surface Pro 7's. But all went back due to my issues with docks and the multimonitor setup I need at my office. None worked with the WD15. I picked up the Surface Dock 2 for the last Surface Pro I tried, and that had its own issues. I had a Wavlink for the HP's, as well as a Belkin thunderbolt 3 dock, both had issues. So I decided to stick for now with my XPS13 and the old dock. But after all that testing, the old dock had issues with the displays being seen... So it was time to replace it.

I had hoped this would work just fine with my Dell, and for the most part, it does. The WD15 was rock solid with this, never an issue, but with this new one, I have had a few times I've had to power cycle the dock to get it to work again. Firmware is updated on it, but a few times when I plugged it in, I had no monitors, and a pop up warning on the computer saying that despite being plugged in my laptop wasn't charging because there wasn't enough power. Considering the size and output of the power supply, I found that a bit annoying.

But mostly it works, about 95% of the time.

There is a slight fan noise once in a while but it's usually lost in the ambient noise of the office space here.

One of my favorite parts on it is the USB C power delivery cable, since it's more flexible than just about any other dock I've had. So it bends around and I don't have issues lining things up easily for where my laptop is positioned on the desk. Even the WD15 dock was a much stiffer cable and had to be in a specific spot so the cable would reach correctly where it had to go.

I've got one 4k monitor off the display port, and a 27"" QHD monitor off the HDMI. And other than a couple random points where they weren't seen at plugin, they seem to be fine.

It's a bit pricey compared to the alternatives, but after all the issues I've had messing with docks lately, I just wanted something that would let me use things again and not spend all my time troubleshooting like the Wavlink one I tried.",0,

I purchased this dock for my brand new Dell Precision 5750 with a Xeon W-10885M CPU and 64Gb of DDR4 Registered memory and 2TB (1TB x 2 raid 0) nvme SSD and the NVidia Quadro RTX 3000 GPU. I use 3 x 3840 x 2160 monitors and thought that I could use this dock to drive the three displays and leverage my nVidia GPU. Didnt work. The HDMI Port detects the 4K monitor as a 2560 x 1440 monitor. It detects the other two monitors as 4K monitors, but only delivers 30Hz refresh rate which is crappy. I almost returned it, but then decided to take my Razer Core X with a Quadro P4000 GPU to the thunderbolt 3 port available on this dock. It worked!! I am now able to drive three displays at 3840 x 2160 @ 60Hz which is great for desktop use. Single cable. It also charges my laptop fairly well. So I decided to keep it. Other docks DO NOT charge the Precision 5750 or the XPS 17, as these laptops do require 130W from the dock to charge them. Having a Razer Core X stowed away behind my two Dell P317Q monitors and the (center) PHL BDM4350 monitor seems to work reasonably well. The P4000 is a great card for programmer use. I am disappointed with Dell for not delivering a single cable solution that can leverage the RTX 3000 through TB3, but I have a solution that works!!
This may not be the solution for everybody, but if you are wondering if you can daisy-chain a Razer Core X or another TB3 Graphics enclosure, that will work. Note that the Razer Core X has enough power to drive pretty large graphics cards. I also have a Razer Core V2 and while that worked, it resulted in some pretty strange USB behavior when I tried to use its USB ports. So your mileage with other TB3 eGPU enclosures may vary. The P4000 is a single-slot GPU which only uses about 150W of power. But My Razer Core X has worked well with other larger cards as well including an nVidia GTX 2080ti and Radeon Vega 64 (Mac use). Unfortunately, if you have a Quadro laptop, you can use an AMD GPU, but you cannot use the GTX gpu and the Quadro GPU together. For some reason, one of the GPUs have to be disabled and this results in some system instability. If you are using Quadro, stick to Quadro or AMD. If you are using GTX then stick to GTX and AMD. Back to the topic of this dock, I didn't want the hassle of returning it as it is the only dock that gives me a single-cable solution and enables me to daisy-chain an eGPU, charge my laptop and connect my other peripherals. Working for me. YMMV.",13,

-----------------
1. The model I was sent was not the WD19TB, but the WD19TBS (notice the last character?)
this meant that it does not have the Audio Jacks on the front and back as advertised. (a pretty big feature if you ask me)
I now see that other people have made that same complaint in this product review section.

2. It came to me dirty somehow. Sealed in non-labelled plastic bags, the power brick still managed to be dirty when I opened it and a smudge on the actual Dock. While I wouldn't have minded this product being labelled as Refurbished (or maybe even used and/or returned) this product description has no such detail in it's listing. Now I can't help but doubt the quality of the product.

3. Never expected a fan in the item, but it's there and it's louder than I would like. Don't use in a silent environment unless you enjoy the ""white noise"" of a fan constantly going. I'm using this in my home office so I don't have people talking around me or the white noise generators at work. Sometimes I want it perfectly quiet instead of music playing and the fan is annoying during these times.",1,

The Dell site sells it for a good bit more, and perhaps this is how they manage the low price.

I had had the older TB16 which suddenly failed out of the blue, as I was opening a Word document. Nothing would restore it. So I ordered this newer version, hoping for fewer problems, and it worked immediately, for just over a week, at which point the lightning bolt on the plug that goes into the computer would no longer light, which means it is not being recognized - the same issue I had with the TB16.

On a lark, I plugged in the TB16, and it works fine now.

IMO these docs, and the flimsy Thunderbot/USB-C plug and socket, should be a lot more reliable, hence one star.",7,

First of all even slightly moving the main connection cable which is multi pin and held in by two screws dropped the monitor signal and shut down the laptop. Try plugging your laptop in without disturbing the cable! The single black button to turn everything on that works so well on my home version (exact same type) has NEVER worked despite endless hours updating BIOS etc. Why should we as a consumer have to do that in any event, surely Dell can come up with an auto suggest and a download? The new Bing search seems to know everything about me despite me never having signed up as one example! Either way that button is useless on this version. The slightest movement of the dock still disrupts the signal even after I paid another $25 for a new master cable.

I am very pleased with this dock, but I just recently purchased it and there have been a few BIOS updates to the Dell Precision 5510 and a few firmware updates for the dock, so I may have missed all of the bugs that have been fixed with the earlier software. The BIOS updates for the 5510 are easy to find, the firmware updates for the dock are not as easy. When going to the Dell support site, find the BIOS and driver updates by typing in your Service Tag and searching. Select the option to find the updates yourself and down near the bottom of the page in the ""Other ways to find drivers"" section and click the link to ""Browse all drivers..."" and the dock firmware should be in there under WD15.

Once the firmware and BIOS are updated, the dock seems to work very well. The only issues I have found with it are when I plug the USB-C cable in, the laptop starts up if it was off and my monitors display the correct screens, but my USB keyboard doesn't work until I get past the Bitlocker screen. This means I have to open the laptop, use the laptop keyboard to type my Bitlocker password, then close my laptop screen to go back to my dual monitor setup. This results in another minor issue that occurs rarely. After closing the laptop, only one of my screens is working, so I go to the display options and see it still considers the laptop screen one of my screens, so I have to open my laptop and close it again to get the laptop to recognize the screen is closed.

Other than that it works great. I have two of them, one for home and one for work. My home one uses the Mini-DP and the HDMI for video, Ethernet, USB for keyboard and mouse on the back, and USB on the front for an external hard drive. My work one uses the HDMI and VGA for video, Ethernet, a USB hub on my monitor that has keyboard, mouse, and USB headset, plus an Engineering tool on the back ports, USB on the front for an external hard drive and USB memory. So each are fully loaded and I have not had any display issues (other than the easily recoverable one I mentioned), speed issues to the external drives, or connection issues to the external Engineering tool I interface with.

The only other downside is, I just got a new personal laptop around the same time (Dell Latitude E5570) that I thought would be compatible with the dock (since it is mentioned on the Dell WD15 website), but it isn't. The E5570 I have only supports the old E-port docking station, which I still have, but now I have to use both and switch my monitors, keyboard, and mouse back and forth. Using and old KVM and a couple HDMI switches made it easier, but not flawless.",5,

I have tried 4 separate docks, Dell's TB15 and TB16 and two from Plugable. The TB15/16 were truly awful products. Each had their own problems: disconnecting the video, dropping Ethernet speeds, garbled audio ports, USB disconnecting, overheating, weird conflicts with strong WiFi signals. Pretty much everything that could go wrong with those docks did. The Plugable docks actually worked *wonderfully* and they have great customer service, but their products are misrepresenting compatibility with the ability to charge an XPS 15 9550 through the USB cable. Their docks that claim Linux compatibility worked great, but I had to keep the power plug into the computer. I wish I would have tried this dock first.

On to the WD15. I'm running Ubuntu 17.04 with kernel 4.12. All BIOS updates have been applied, as is critical for any USB-C/thunderbolt functionality to work on these recent Dell machines. For the most part, that means installing Windows to apply the updates. While BIOS updates can be applied from DOS, dock updates MUST be done from Windows. So expect to install WIndows 10 (I recommend Rufus to install it on an external drive) to get everything working.

With all updates applied, this thing works AMAZING. I only power a single external display, but I use nearly all ports: HDMI or DisplayPort both work fine, I've got ~4 USB ports occupied, audio out the front port, and ethernet. All work, no drivers or special downloads needed for the dock itself under Linux. I've run the internal and one external display both with the nVidia (running nvidia-381 package) and Intel graphics (with drivers installed from 01.org). All the usual hoops of getting something to work on Linux aside, this dock works great. Audio has been completely consistent (a near miracle).

Even with my XPS 9550 power demands, charging through the USB-C port works. It doesn't seem to have any power charging issues as the Plugable docks did. The dock even seems to work okay with sleep and resume. Although occasionally I do have to unplug/replug after a reboot. Some times the second display does not immediately wake up, but a quick trip to the Displays control panel or cycling through the display options with F8 fix the issue for the duration of the session.

The only small issue I've had is that external USB hard disks seem to start up and spin down repeatedly when plugged into the USB ports and the computer is asleep or unplugged. This does not seem to be a Linux issue because it happens even if the computer isn't plugged in. For now I'm simply plugging it in after the computer is awake or whenever I need to do a backup.",10,

With the latest firmware updates, stability is improving. Flickering is almost entirely eliminated at this point. There are still issues getting it to come back from Standby from time to time, but this is rapidly approaching ""good"" status.

I am using this with an XPS 13 9360 (Win 10 pro), which is Kaby Lake based.

First off, this will EVENTUALLY be a great piece of tech. The dock makes it so all you need to plug in is a single type-C cable, which is super awesome. It charges your laptop, has multiple displays and tons of ports, and it all works pretty well for a business environment.

HOWEVER... it's unstable as hell. As of 11/16/2016, there are so many problems that I can't possibly roll this out to my entire company. Here's some examples:

- If you boot the computer with the dock installed, any usb devices plugged into the dock will freeze up for about 1 second every 10 seconds. You have to unplug the dock, wait about 15 seconds, then plug it back in to fix.
- Monitors will begin randomly flickering, then stop flickering.
- Monitors sometimes don't get detected properly. You must unplug the dock, wait 15 seconds, then plug it back in to fix.
- Ethernet will just shut down for about 5 seconds every once in a while. No discernible pattern.
- Getting system to resume out of sleep mode is completely hit and miss. Sometimes you can hit keys on the keyboard to wake it up, sometimes you can hit the power button on the dock to get it to work. Sometimes you have to undock and open the laptop up.

I think that all of these issues are entirely due to how early the tech is. It may be fixed by drivers or hardware revisions. But at the current time, while this is very exciting, it's just not ready to roll out en-masse.",6,

In particular I'm using a Razer Blade Stealth previously running Ubuntu 16.04 and currently running Arch. The dock works ""okay"" most of the time. I realize that neither Ubuntu 16.04 nor Arch are officially supported by this device, thus I'm limiting my negative assessment to 3 stars instead of 2. That said, the hardware should be pretty universal and it being officially supported on Ubuntu 14.04 should mean that I would have no issues on newer operating systems presuming I have the appropriate drivers installed.

So let's get down to it. The charging works great. It has consistently worked with no issues so I can't fault this device here. Charging of USB devices also works fabulously.

The ""Displayport over USB-C"" functionality generally works well but with some quirks: displays using the VGA port can be very slow to wake up; and displays using the mini-DP port will sometimes randomly cut in and out after waking up (a quick fix normally requires locking the computer and waking it back up again). The issue persisted across both operating systems so I'm blaming the dock. I should also note that I have two of these docks (one at home, one at the office) and the issue is persistent across both of them. That said, I haven't had any issues with display recognition nor have I had driver issues.

The networking also generally works. Occasionally the system won't recognize the wired connection. This generally isn't an issue because I have pretty reliable WiFi access both at home and at work, but it's still worth noting as I can see how this could be a problem for some people.

The USB ports and headphone/microphone jack worked about 40% of the time on Ubuntu and don't work at all on Arch. This is kind of annoying because I have to keep separate USB hubs and I can't just leave a pair of headphones permanently connected to the dock. Part of the promise of this dock was to have everything working with a single cable and now I require a minimum of two. This isn't a massive issue or anything and is easily worked around, but it's still really annoying.

Anyway, I purchased these over the Thunderbolt 3 docks due to price, size, and me not requiring the extra functionality of Thunderbolt 3 over standard USB-C. Additionally the reviews for the Thunderbolt 3 version left me somewhat skittish as people were reporting problems with officially supported operating systems. I fully intend to experiment with other USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 docks in the future and I have no intention of keeping these should they continue to not meet my needs in the future.",1,

Overall, I've been very happy with this device, once the set up is out of the way. I am using this with one of the new (Kaby Lake) Inspiron 13 7000s. I'll deal with set up at the end for any one interested.

I like that the size of the dock is so small, and thus it doesn't take up much room. I also chose this option because it gives 3 different display connections (although it will only output a maximum of 2 extended displays). Also, the power delivery works great with the Inspiron, although I've read that it won't deliver power to non-Dell machines over 60 Watts, whereas Dell gets up to 130W.

I also like that there are 5 USB ports, and the lack of a dedicated USB-C doesn't really bother me. On my dock, one of the front-facing USB3 ports doesn't work, hence the subtraction of a star. It's not enough to return it, however, as competing options are twice as expensive, and the pluggable has had a number of reports of the dock frying the laptop.

So, if you're looking for a single-cable solution, I think this is the best option out there, and the price is an added bonus.

To set it up:
1. update the bios (go to the manufacturer's website and look in the drivers & downloads section for your machine)
2. install the displaylink drivers (go to the displaylink website and download the drivers for your operating system).

This second point is important, as dell, at least for my machine, hasn't posted drivers for the dock yet. But the displaylink ones work flawlessly, and from what I hear, often are newer than the ones on manufacturer's websites anyway.",3,

It honestly made me a little hesitant on buying it. However, Amazon always has a great return policy so I figured I had nothing to lose. I'm so glad I took the chance.

I was super pleased with the set up. It was easy and very straightforward. It displays beautifully on two dell displays and I also tried it with my one acer x34 gaming display. However, I bought this for my office work. I have hooked it up to my Dell XPS 15 (9560) and MacBook 12 (2015). They both work flawlessly with the two Dell displays. They both charge and output like they should, for the most part.

The Mac displays to both, but they are mirrored. The Mac also was very finicky with the Acer x34. I think that is the Mac not being able to push that many pixels or possible resolution issues, however it does read both Dell displays and reads the x34.

The XPS 15 displays to both dell displays and the x34 perfectly. (Not all three at the same time of course). I don't know if it is the XPS or the dock, but I when I have the two Dell displays or the x34 hooked up I can open the lid and it comes right up as another monitor. Then when I flip it back down it goes back to the original setup. No hiccups what so ever.

The sleep button on the dock works great too. I've had no issues, like other reviewers, with hitting the sleep button on the dock and then coming back from lunch and hitting it again. Within a few seconds I'm at my Windows login and ready to go. It has had no issues picking up the three different keyboards and two different mice I've tried. (I like to test everything I can in that 30 days)

I would not hesitate to buy another one if I needed it. I really have tried to throw everything I can at this dock so I could justify a return. However, this thing has performed PERFECTLY! (Well minus the few things with the Mac, but it's a Mac so I half figured it would've blown up when I connected it.)",2,

In order to get it to work, I had to install the thunderbolt firmware, the thunderbolt power firmware, and then the ASMedia USB 3.0 extended host drivers from Dell's site; I used the XPS 9550 to page to get the USB drivers specifically. After that I plugged it into my Alienware 15 R2 and it just worked! I was definitely scared by the numerous bad reviews for the triple display dock, but so far I haven't had any of the issues described with the dual display. I figured I'd give it a chance since Amazon's return policy is so great, but will definitely update if I run into issues. Like others, I am confused by why they looped all of the reviews together for the different models as there is definitely some discrepancy between them. One thing to note is that this will not provide power if your system requires over 130 watts of power; mine asks for 180. I also wouldn't recommend this for an enterprise roll out quite yet as firmware might need to be updated on each individual device in order to make this dock work. I'm sure you could work a firmware update into the OS deployment, but this will require testing/tinkering before being confident that all thunderbolt / USB Type-C devices in an environment will work with it. Otherwise, it's great for use at home, adds some needed ports, and definitely makes cable management easier.",2,

When Apple switched to Thunderbolt 3, we could not longer use our Thunderbolt Displays with new MacBooks without kludgy adapters, and we couldn't provide power to the laptop with the Thunderbolt Display at all.

This dock is a good replacement for the Thunderbolt Displays when paired with a good standard HDMI monitor. The big caveat is with the Mini DisplayPort connector. I tried using one of our old LED Cinema Displays with it, and the maximum resolution I could set was 720p in MacOS. Next, I tried a Dell UltraSharp U2715H, and while there were a lot more resolution options, it was about vertical pixels short of choosing the native resolution of the Dell. Switching to HDMI solved that problem: macOS automatically picked the correct resolution.

The side effect of this is that with macOS, because of the mDP issue, we can't run dual monitors at a decent resolution from this dock. I would assume that this is a macOS driver issue. Hopefully it will be addressed.

macOS also doesn't require any external drivers or software. We plugged it in, and it worked.

We plugged a Windows machine into the same dock with mDP, and it worked fine. My assumption is that you could drive two displays from a Windows machine with no trouble.

This dock has me considering upgrading to a 2016 MacBook Pro or 2015 MacBook. We'll see. ;)",2,

Callihan,5.0,2017-12-16 00:00:00,美國,,"Update: three things to be aware of - 1) check the Dell web site for monitor resolutions the WD15 supports. While it worked fine for my current monitor at 1920x1200, it will not support the higher resolution monitor that I plan to get in the near future. Therefore, I had to return this and get the TB16 instead; 2) the TB16 has a MUCH shorter USB-C/Thunderbolt cable attached to the dock which may be good or bad depending on your situation; 3) USB and sound output from the dock didn't work until I rebooted and received a prompt stating I needed to go through a couple steps as Administrator to allow the Thunderbolt connection to the dock. Until I got that prompt I was concerned the ports were not working for some reason.

After many years with a Dell E-Port dock as the foundation of my home office setup which lasted through many Dell laptop upgrades, I was mildly surprised to find that the Latitude 7480 did away with the legacy E-Port connector. I was then dismayed to see inconsistent if not poor reviews of the WD15 and the TB16 as well as the WLD15 wireless dock. I decided to give this WD15 a try since it was the least expensive and has the ability to be mounted behind certain Dell monitors freeing up desk space. First, Amazon Prime delivered it in less than 16 hours! Second, upon plugging in power, monitor, and laptop, everything works fine. I don't know what to make of the complaints others have posted. Power, video (I've tried both VGA and HDMI-to-DVI with an Amazon Basics cable successfully), audio, Ethernet, and USB devices (wireless keyboard and mouse, USB microphone) all ""just work"". To me this is better than the wireless dock since the wireless can't provide power meaning you still need to plug the laptop into its own power supply. With the WD15, the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 connection provides power and device connectivity more or less like the old E-Port dock used to do.",22,

The most amazing thing about it is that it connects to everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, through USB type C. You can connect the included charger, up to two displays, up to FIVE usb devices (three of the USB ports supply power), speakers on the back, headphones on the front, and even Ethernet for a hardwired internet connection. And yes, ALL of that electrical information (video, audio, mouse and keyboard, external storage, internet connection, you name it, AND power to charge your battery) passes through a single USB-C cable that comes out of the side of the dock. Truly amazing.

As an engineering student who is constantly using my tiny Dell XPS 13 laptop, I find it very refreshing to plug my laptop in to charge when I get back to my dorm and simultaneously use it with my 25 inch monitor, mouse, keyboard, and external hard drive to work on things that are easier with these peripherals.

I could not recommend the Dell WD15 highly enough.

P.S. Remember to install all the drivers from the Dell website. This is not a “plug and play” device. It takes a little setup before you plug it in for the first time.

P.P.S. Get the 180W version. When I bought mine, it was only like $15 more than the 130W version and it’s worth it for faster charging and ensured support of lots of peripherals. (If you have a bigger laptop, you may need the 180W for your machine to even charge. Check the Dell website to see if it’s required for your system)",1,

I am very happy with the “Dell WD15 Monitor Dock 4K with 180W Adapter, USB-C”. I attach the dock to a Dell XPC 13 9365 laptop using the USB Type C port, connecting to a 4K monitor (via the HDMI port), RJ-45 Ethernet port, a USB 3.0 device, and USB 2.0 device. The USB Type C port charges the XPC laptop while maintaining all the connections. It’s useful having both USB 2 and USB 3 ports because some devices (such as older wireless mouse devices and keyboards) are not compatible with both USB standards and require either USB 3 or, USB 1 or 2.

I am not experiencing any of the problems some buyers here report with the Dell WD15 Monitor Dock. I am using the dock in a small business setting with a Windows Server and 14 workstations. My HD monitors look great with no flickering, the gigabit Ethernet port runs very fast, the USB 1/2/3 ports are flawless.

I believe the problems I see people reporting with this dock can be avoided by updating their computer's BIOS and drivers. I did this and the dock is functioning perfectly.

Based upon my experience with the “Dell WD15 Monitor Dock 4K with 180W Adapter, USB-C”, I can comfortably recommend this product with no reservations whatsoever.",1,

Not sure I'm keeping the XPS or the Type-C dock; I'm partially waiting to see what docking solutions Lenovo brings on the X270 whenever it launches, or maybe bailing to a Spectre x360.

Even after a firmware update, only the power delivery and video outs work correctly in Linux (connected to an XPS 13 9350, kernel 4.6). Ethernet is untested.

I use the single usb-c cable from this product to my laptop.

The hub:
- provides power to my laptop over usb-c
- is connected to one 1080p monitor via HDMI
- is connected to my headphones
- is connected via usb to my phone
- is connected via usb to another 4 port usb hub
- is connected via usb to an external 2.5"" HDD
- that 4 port hub is connected to several other minor usb peripherals

from my laptop over the usb-c connection i have no problems seeing any of the items connected to the hub, never had any problems with the monitor displaying, and my laptop is always charged.

I think the important thing is to make sure the correct drivers are installed and up to date, and that any bios related settings are correctly configured on the laptop.",0,

I still dont understand why, if a simply thunderbolt 3 to display port can do 4k at 60hz, why not even if nothing else is running at the same time this docking station cannot do it.
also, if I check disk speeds of a SSD, I get 400mbs of two I tested indivdually, but if I run two tests at the same time for two ssds connected, I get about half the speed (245mbs in one disk, 155 in the other), so this is simply bottlenecking despite the more than abundant bandwith of the thunderbolt 3 port. so my advice, that if you can afford some cable clutter, just get a thunderbolt 3 to display port, and a usb 3 replicator. that and a hdmi cable, should give you 4k 60hz, 1080hz, and decent speeds for anything except NVME type of external disks; this dell adapter does not do much more.

After looking up a solution, I found that Dell had a forum post that instructed you to update bios and drivers to fix the issues with the USB ports.

I unfortunately decided to not return the dock since some of the post on Amazon stated that it fixed the issue. If I would have read the posts on the Dell forum, I probably would have made a different choice. I installed all of the software in order, and everything seemed to work. Even the USB ports on my connected Dell monitor were operational. After letting it sit for a few minutes, I came back and I had lost the USB ports. The computer had gone into sleep mode, so I figured that may be the cause. After restarting, the ports came back on and I turned off the sleep setting when plugged in.
This apparently did not work. I have lost my USB ports again.
Do not waste your money on this Dell Dock until they can fix these bugs. The only thing that works is the monitor connection, and you can purchase an adapter for the Type C port for just a few dollars. I have a laptop that was designed for this dock and it still does not work. For $140, this dock should work right out the box.

The laptop has USB C for power and a separate USB C for display.

Right after I received the dock, I plugged it into the USB C display port and it didn't work. The laptop didn't recognize the monitor that was plugged into the dock and the USB ports on the dock were also unavailable (I connected several USB drives and my phone and nothing was recognized). After doing some reading online, someone mentioned that I needed to update the firmware. I went to Dell's website and followed their instructions and downloaded the firmware update. I'm not sure if the update was successful since my experience during the update was not even close to Dell's documentation.

Regardless, after the update, the dock did recognize my monitor and it appeared to be working. However, the display would flicker on and off when connected to the dock. It would black out for a second or two before coming back online. This would occur several times a minute. Pretty frustrating. The USB ports on the dock still don't work, even after the firmware update.

The dock does power my laptop when it's plugged into the power USB C but then I don't have access to the extra monitor. I mainly was enticed by this device because of the power capability and the extra monitors. I can ONLY have one or the other and not both.

This product is pretty much a fail. I now have an overpriced laptop power charger and will now need to get another device for the multiple monitors. I don't recommend this to anyone.",3,

Unbelieveable that a top of the line computer from Dell in 2017 cannot be hooked up to more than one hi res monitor at a time because the only docking station that will work with it isn't up to par.

Even when hooked up to multiple lower resolution displays I got tons of flickering on and off at the beginning of each boot sequence that can't be good for the monitors. This is despite having the latest BIOS, Drivers and Firmware for all relevant hardware and having spoken with Dell Support about the issue.

Also, I get warning everytime I start computer warning that the power supply is underpowered and telling me that I need to use a 130w supply. This is despite the fact that I am using the exact 130w power supply the message is referring to. Though I was finally able to get rid of the message through the BIOS the fact is that the laptop battery is likely being forced to compensate at times for the underpowered psu.

I have it hooked to my brand new Dell XPS 15 (9550) ordered Jun 2016. The HDMI, VGA, Thunderbolt charging work great. Whenever the laptop wakes up after going to sleep, the monitor hooked to the display port connection blinks on and off until I plug and replug it. I do have this hooked up through a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter which could be a compatibility issue. All the USB ports (3.0 and 2.0) on the dock randomly work or don't work whenever the laptop wakes up -- doesn't matter if the devices connected are USB or self powered. I also have an external HD hooked to one of the USB 3.0 ports that after being plugged in for a while, will start disconnecting and reconnecting every 10 seconds or so. The audio port will randomly switch to LOUD white noise in the middle of a video or audio clip. I have none of these problems if I hook the devices directly to the laptop, not through this dock. All of this is infuriating considering the laptop and dock are brand new.

I tried buying a new dock to see if I just got a bad one but it had all the same issues so I returned it. I also have scoured the internet and installed all the drivers I could find. Nothing has helped. I think I'm going to have to buy a USB hub and resign myself to plugging in 2 things to my laptop instead of 1 whenever I'm at home.",2,

I also thought that I may need to force it to use RGB, but that also failed after trying a couple different scripts with SIP disabled. I tried four different HDMI cables, and five different monitors. I also tried wiggling the cables, and trying various combinations of adaptors. Much to my dismay nothing I threw at it worked. Also if you are hoping to get two displays in addition to the MacBook itself that will also not work. Now I blame Apple for this for not supporting MST, but thats a whole other rant. I did confirm everything else on the dock works fine. The charging works fine at the correct wattage. It looks like those of us that need to use two external (or more) monitors along with other legacy ports (Desktop Replacement) are forced to wait until someone else comes up with a better solution.

Recently I purchased new XPS 13 with touch screen and this dock station to connect my 2 dell monitors.
I chose this dock station because it can power my XPS 13 thru USB C port.
Long story short, this thing is not working with XPS 13 at all.
1.constant display setting changes
2.monitor resolution is set but top part of screen won't fit to screen size
3.XPS 13 bios update was done because Dell recommend to update it to make WD15 working
4.still same or worse
5.ethernet port won't work well (connection is on and off erratically)
6.power button on WD15 sometimes no responsive
7.XPS 13 tries to reconize dock constantly and mkaing bell nosie all the time which makes me drive nuts while trying to my work

Now I am back to my old Dell docking station (D3000 model) and working fine
Only issue with D3000 was plug in power cord and dock connector to laptop.

It is possible of some compatibility issue with WD15 and XPS 13 but they are all Dell and can't believe this happens.
I do not recommend to any XPS13 owner to get this because your time is very valuable like mine

Second unexpected fail is extremely unstable Ethernet. It just hangs up whole dock station when I'm starting massive copy over a local network. Moreover, the Ethernet device is just disappearing at all when some other USB devices are connected, external HDD drive, for example. I have to switch off whole dock station for getting it back. I'm transferring my data from the old laptop during the unbeatable time already.

I purchased a separate WD15 docking station for my office at home along with 2 additional monitors so that I could replicate the set up I have at my office. It worked at first but then after a few minutes I noticed that both monitors were very grainy and then both started randomly going in and out on a consistent basis. I connected my laptop to each monitor individually with an HDMI to verify that the monitors were not defective and as expected they both worked just fine. After doing some reading it appears that a ton of people have this same problem with the WD15 and that apparently Dell can't get their act together with their docks. I would not waste your money on this and look for another dock that works as expected on a consistent basis.,2,

This keyboard is clearly designed only for use with a desktop -- first there's no power switch - it's always on. This is the first wireless keyboard I've used in twenty years that doesn't have a power switch, and since this uses AAA batteries, this is not acceptable if you're not at home near replacement batteries. If you're not at home, you'll need to be able to shut this off when you're not using it to save power, and if you're on the go, you'd need to turn it off when you toss it in your laptop bag.

The second issue is that there's not a place for the USB wireless receiver. You can't store it in the keyboard or hide it in the mouse - you plug it in and leave it. This is fine for a desktop where you could put it in the back, but for a laptop you're probably going to lose it pretty quickly.

Other than those two absolute deal breakers, it's a nice office keyboard. It has the full number pad, responsive keys with a nice bounce to them, and as a nice bonus, it comes with a standard wireless Dell mouse. If you're looking for a desktop-only keyboard, this could work for you, but if you can wait and afford a $30 cost increase, I'd recommend the Dell Pro KM5221W instead which actually has a power switch, so you can use that one at home or on the go.",6,

Super easy plug-and-play replacement of my existent, rather bulky Logitech wireless keyboard / mouse combo.
Light & compact.
Looks good. I like the matte tone.
Ergonomic.
Keys and mouse easily responsive.
Came with Duracell quality batteries for keyboard & mouse.

Cleaning, batteries, remove and reinstall... nothing fixed it. I looked around on Amazon and bought the Tecknet based on reviews. What a mistake! I wrote a review on that one. Terrible mouse. Avoid it. I didn't even waste my time to return it. It felt good to throw it in the trash.
I like Dell equipment. My work laptop is Dell. My gaming PC is Dell Alienware. Love them. So, I spent about 30% more on this Dell mouse and I love it. One AA battery so it is not heavy. Slightly beveled sides (wider on the top) so it's easy to pick up if needed. Very comfortable in the hand and is symmetrical so it's great for left handers too. I called it a wireless mouse because it works with an included USB dongle or with your native Bluetooth. The dongle stores inside if not used. Easy to set up - follow the instructions because there is an option to link to Bluetooth or the dongle. You can switch between the two, indicated on the bottom. The power switch is good. I only turn it off when it's in my backpack. On the desk, it sleeps and wakes seemlessly. The optical sensor on the bottom works onall surfaces and there is no red laser to blind you when you look for the switch. You can adjust the dots per inch sensitivity for your needs. This helps me for drawing sketches with the mouse. There are buttons. The usual left, middle, and right. The middle button is a wide scroll wheel, and it works as left and tight tilt, too. Two thumb buttons (for right hand use). All buttons are configurable through the provided application. I'm not using them for anything yet, but it's a nice option.
All-in-all I highly recommend this inexpensive wireless mouse for every day use. I have an expensive Alienware wired gaming mouse specificly for gaming use. But for work documentation, occasional CAD use, surfing the web, this is my new favorite. Dell MS5120W.",12,

The software app wanted to upgrade the firmware, If you have trouble getting it to complete, try connecting with the Radio frequency USB, as Bluetooth mode didn't work for me, but it completed first try with the Radio USB connection.

Big mistake!

This mouse looks cool and feels good, but that's about it. I have to preface this by saying if you're used to using non-Apple mice you may like this mouse. The problem is... after using an Apple mouse for so many years and then switching, it's like going from a Ferrari to a Dodge.

First of all the scroll wheel is pathetic. It clunky scrolling is anything but smooth. Not only does it not give you a smooth scroll feel, but even worse scrolling a page or program with is so wildly hard to get to exactly where you want to go. With an Apple mouse you scroll effortlessly and smoothly to exactly where you're trying to go.

Secondly, moving the cursor around is also anything but smooth; at least compared to Apple's.

Like I said, if you come from a PC world this may all be natural to you. But DO NOT buy this to replace an Apple mouse. You'll be sorely disappointed.",4,

My advice: check who the seller is before you add to your cart. When I did it, it automatically chose Derrick INC (I didn't change anything.) The charger works, but if the USB port is important to you, consider selecting a different seller.",2,

In less than 30 seconds from hitting the Power button, I'm booted up and logged in to the OS. It's working great! No issues running any of the apps. In just over a month, I haven't had any issues. Fast and smooth sailing.

I will add that the laptop's description advertises it to be a ""Core i5-1135G7"", an 11th generation i5 processor. I just noticed that I did not get the 11th generation i5 processor in my laptop that is advertised. It has the 10th generation i5 processor (Core™ i5-1035G1) in it. I did not get what I was supposed to get, and the seller just told me ""why"" it is listed wrong - no apparent intention of fixing the listing. Be aware of this before you buy. You may not get what you think, either. I gave it 4 stars for that reason. The hardware is good, it's just not the hardware that I bought.",1,

I needed to move from 2 computers into 1 and ended up getting a MacBook Pro and this monitor to replace an iMac and an older MacBook Pro. I would have preferred to get the 32"" Apple monitor but I didn't have $5K to spend so this had to suffice. Still a relatively expensive monitor in my opinion. The good stuff; the screen size and resolution is fine enough for viewing at an arms distance on my desk. It's not quite as revealing as my 5K was, but everything looks good, including fine text, so I don't feel like I took a significant step backward on resolution for every day use. The thing has a TON of built-in ports and they all work great! I use almost all of them to connect my peripherals and devices. You forget how many you need until you get a new computer that doesn't have many ports (Apple) and then you feel relieved that you can plug everything you own into the monitor and the Mac sees it immediately! The bad stuff; the screen is matte and reflects sunlight more than my glossy iMac did. I was surprised by how much more sensitive this screen was by comparison. Definitely something to consider if you use the screen in a room with a lot of ambient light. On cloudy days and other times when the ambient light is low, the screen looks fantastic and is easy on my eyes. I also miss having built-in: mic, camera and speakers. I use my new Mac in clamshell mode and not having these basic audio and video functions on the monitor seems like a miss to me. This is not an el-cheopo monitor. My workaround is using my iPhone as the camera and mic and I plugged a small powered speaker into the line out port which works fine for every day sound but I would have preferred if the monitor had these items built-in so I didn't have to figure out the work-arounds. All in all, I would recommend this monitor. I think the pros outweigh the cons and until a more full-featured one comes along this is probably one of the best 32"" monitors in the sub $1K price range.",15,

I hooked up my MacBook Pro at the same time and 4K 60hz worked very well and charged the MacBook too through usb c. The picture is colorful and bright, there are many color settings and I managed to get a close match to the MacBook Pro 14” screen color by adjusting the white balance.
The picture by picture mode is awesome, having a windows machine on one half and a Mac on the other half works very well. The 32” screen is large enough to work this way and the images autosize to fill the screen.
The Dell software is great, you can adjust the brightness, contrast and any other picture setting through both the mac and the windows pc without having to touch any buttons on the monitor.
I was concerned about 32” 4K and mac text sharpness, no problem here it’s very good. I came from a 5k iMac and the 4K 32” passes my sharpness needs no problem. I don’t need to change the resolution from 4K on the 32” it is small txt but readable. I have used 2K resolution but I preferred the 4K when the monitor is at arms length infront of me.
The brightness is good. I was concerned about this since I had a apple studio display for a month in spring and 600nits was great. However, the Dell is bright enough and I tended to use brightness between 90 and 100% during the sunny day which is ideal.
What would I change?
(1) not much to be honest
(2) I prefer glossy screens but that’s personal and the Dell is by no means unattractive
(3) add speakers and a microphone. I’m 50/50 about this as I may prefer my own choice of studio mike and monitors with good bass which only the studio display has!
(4) longer usbc cable, 3ft….really !
(5) I find the stand bulky the footprint is large, it’s very sturdy though and very effective. I’m just more in favor of the apple studio stand but that’s a smaller monitor.

In summary, a very sturdy monitor with great color accuracy and works very well with my mac and with windows pc which is exactly what I need - so I ordered one for home and can’t wait to start to use it and improve my productivity.",27,

I have tried 6 different monitors recently and IPS black displays have consistently come out on top as the best bang for the buck. If you have the money to afford a 4K mini led or oled monitor then by all means but these dell monitors having amazing image quality for the price.

Having tried both the 27” and 32” version I can say the only difference was size and price. Although 4K on a 27” has greater ppi, the picture quality on the 32” was almost indistinguishable from the 27”. The 32” is however $300 more, so if you don’t need the extra space, go with the 27”.

Both monitors us the LG IPS Black displays, so if you want panels with the exact same picture quality, you can buy LG’s version of the monitors for significantly cheaper. $650 vs $850 for the 32” version. What Dell does is buy the display, improves quality control and warranty, packages it better by making it frameless on 4 sides instead of 3, adds features like a built in hub, kvm etc, so if you need all those extra features then buy Dell but if you’re just looking for an IPS display with the same image quality, LG has alternatives for much cheaper.",69,

I also recently tried the new Apple Studio monitor. That one wins from a pure quality point of view, but it's just too pricey for what offers. The Dell I had to fiddle with settings to get it to stop looking terrible. I'm specifically mostly concerned with text clarity because I'm a software developer, and this would be my primary monitor to stare at code all day. The Dell is OK once you set it to one notch over into scaled with ""more space"" in Apple's dumbed down selector. I would have expected the Dell's native to be optimal, so that was weird.

I also use this one vertically.. so one note is that 32"" vertical is just about too tall. I found my neck cricking just a bit when looking up to the top (I have it centered in front of my eyes).

Anyways, even with fiddling, the quality is not there. I shouldn't expect it, either, given the difference in pixel density, but I thought I'd see if it was good enough. Not quite, in my view. But I'm finicky.

The brightness was just about good enough. A smidge less bright than the UltraFine, but in my room with lots of windows it did OK.

I wish there were more ""Retina"" monitors available. I started looking mainly because I've noticed some ghosting on my UltraFines, and I don't really want to buy this ""old"" technology again, but I also don't want to spend $1700 for basically the same thing screen-wise.

So this one is OK, but just barely good enough for my purposes. I decided not to keep it.",26,

Brilliantly sharp 4K resolution, great color, and plenty bright for the type of office/productivity things I do on a daily basis.

Unfortunately, the KVM functionality was problematic. This was one of the big selling points for purchasing a monitor like this. I connected two computers, one of which was a laptop using the single USB-C with 90W of power delivery. I installed the drivers from Dell's website, along with they Dell Display Manager 2.x software. It worked OK for about five minutes. But then it started registering ""USB devide not recognized"" errors when switching between computers. My USB devies (one of which was a keyboard) continued to work OK, but the Windows device manager showed an error saying ""Unknown USB Device (Invalid Device Descriptor)"". When I disconnected the two USB devices, the error would remain visible in the device manager until I removed the USB connection between the computer and screen itself.

I called Dell support and they suggested I needed to install the proper device drivers. I confirmed that I had already done that, and the problem persisted after rebooting, and even after removing the Dell Display Manager software.

For a while, everything was basically operational. The USB warnings were annoying, but they didn't keep me from working. That run came to an end and my keyboard would not function through the monitor's KVM setup. At first the laptop continued working (with the single USB-C connection).

My plan was to plug my personal desktop into the Display port and my work laptop into the USB-C port with the 90w of power. On paper this monitor can do that...but in execution there is a major flaw. This monitor also has a feature called DPBS (Dell Power Button Sync) which links the monitor's power button to the Dell power button on my work laptop. With both machines plugged in I can't turn just the monitor off or else it will turn my work laptop off. I have to unplug my laptop and then I need another power source. There is not way to disable this absolutely stupid feature which is counter productive to the built in docking station and KVM. If you plan to actually use this feature look elsewhere.

Price is competitive for a 32inch IPS panel with a hub built in, ethernet is a much added welcome, Factory calibration is good. And thats is where the good stops which is really what a good monitor is supposed to do. Have a good image which this one does have. (Try to find it on sale under $900)

Cons:

* Slow hub (let me explain) When you use USB C (DP Alt) you have to choose between either higher resolution + Low Data Transfers [USB 2.0] or Choose Lower Resolution + High Data Speeds [3.0]

* IPS panel coating on this monitor is does not match the price asking. I wish DELL had given us an option to have this as glossy.

* Smart HDR and IPS Black are TERRIBLE: When enabled it makes me question if this is indeed an IPS panel or a VA one.

So THIS MONITOR IS NOT FOR YOU:

* if your work requires the absolute best resolution and high data speeds. Highest supported resolution is 4K at 60HZ which is plenty but this cannot be combined which high speed data transfers of usb 3.0 nor 3.1 gen 2 which this monitor advertises.

* If you require HDR (It is there but IT IS NOT)

* If you want a monitor to make you more productive. The cons will have you looking for more things to add instead of actually getting to work.

This MONITOR IS FOR YOU:

* if you can afford it without saving too much, if you have been saving for awhile to buy a monitor please pass on this one. If buying this monitor using credit card to pay in installments, I would also recommend you pass this one.

* The monitor is also for you if you only need high resolution and not fast data transfers all at once. Just one or the other (it is a trade)

* The Monitor is also for you if you need high data transfer hub but dont care much using a resolution lower than 4k 60HZ (4k @30HZ, 2.5K @30HZ, 2K @60HZ, or 1080P @60HZ) all testings done with a 2017 maxed out MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt (USB C) to DP Alt mode.

* This monitor is also for you, if you live in reality that most people don't actually need fast speeds past USB 2.0 anyways (up to 480Mbps). Yes if you have 1Gig Internet you will see a drop when you select high resolution as speeds will be reduced which will affect your internet speeds. Yes if you are transferring large 4k files you will have to wait for forever. But if you are a casual user, transferring small documents, and occasional 2gb or 5gb video files - YOU WILL BE FINE.

I wish DELL did not rush this monitor, I wish they would have taken feedback from all past Q series both QS, QE, Q and listened to the users pain points and address those here.

SHOULD YOU BUY?

* If you can wait for next year's release, by all means wait. Save that money by the time next year comes you will have earned interests on it and you will get a much better monitor.

* If you cant wait, see how much you have made this past month and if you can afford to buy this monitor without affect next month's bills and spending, then go for it. It is a good monitor just Not GREAT and no off in terms of Price to performance. Even at 32inch note that most likely you will end up scaling both in MacOS and Windows. Which begs the question if you really even need a 32inch.

* If you CAN'T wait but DON'T have hundreds of dollars to buy this monitor then please consider Dell's own Dell S2722QC 27-inch 4K USB-C which is available on Amazon at $380. For the money, this is a much better monitor, has USB C and can charge a 15inch MacBook Pro. The display panel also looks incredible and yes comparable to the QE. To the naked eye, one may even argue that they are same panels. Also at 27inch it looks very sharp.

These are honest and humble opinions from someone who has been waiting for so long for the perfect monitor at a reasonable price. While I have decided to keep this monitor (THIS IS NOT THE PERFECT Monitor) For now it does the job, but eventually 3 years to five I will be changing this one I suspect. And I wish DELL had a program where they can buy back these if they end up fixing all the issues mentioned above by next year.

I hope this review has been helpful in giving you insights about this monitor and your purchase decision. Thank you for reading and I wish you well!

I originally submitted this review on Dell's website but was censored with no communication as to why they wouldn't publish it. Only said it violated community guidelines. I am no expert whether financial nor tech but I wanted to provide some honest reflections from someone who bought this monitor with their own money and not sponsored. If only Dell had chosen to make this monitor's ALT DP Thunderbolt then this would be an A+ monitor instead of a B- (Since thunderbolt can carry both power and high speed data but USB C is limited which is where this monitor falls short.",69,

One thing that I can confirm is that you cannot have high speed USB AND 4K 60Hz refresh rate over USB-C at the same time. You have to choose and 60Hz is the clear winner. For me that was OK because the other USB ports are being used for lower bandwidth items like web cam, key/mouse, and for a sound bar.

No other real negatives that I have found. Solid construction and great picture.",2,

Longevity is as what you would expect of a low-end keyboard. If highly abused, do not expect it to last more than a month. If the user takes good care of it, it may last up to 6 months of heavy use. The mouse as well has the same life expectancy. Key tension wise, the keyboard is very soft & to some may be hard to get used to if they prefer the more tactile response. The mice we've received are clicky & loud so that may be annoying to some people. I myself don't mind the click sound as it lets me know if I've selected something. Get this if you just want a basic setup similar to what comes with Dell computers. If you need a more ergonomic keyboard, look somewhere else.
p.s. Amazon wouldn't submit my previous review because it mentioned packaging. They don't want customers to know that resellers do not package goods like OM goods (see picture). I prefer the original packaging from Dell because it's easier to store these in bulk.",0,

Ho preso la versione 130W totalmente a caso, in quanto non è chiaramente specificato se si sta acquistando la versione 130W o la versione 180W; per capirlo bisogna spulciare bene nelle caratteristiche, cosa che io ho fatto dopo aver scoperto di aver preso la 130W. Comunque per il mio XPS13 è più che sufficiente visto che l'alimentatore di serie ha appena 45W.
La docking è molto comoda, replica tutte le porte che possono servire per un normale utilizzo, compreso il pulsante di accensione e le prese audio (cuffie davanti e line dietro), e si collega al mio XPS con una singola USB-C.
Attenzione, se usate più monitor, considerate che ci sono dei limiti nella risoluzione dei vari monitor (li trovate facilmente in rete o sul sito Dell). Io ne ho uno solo in QHD quindi per me va benissimo.
E' completamente silenzioso e fino ad ora non ho mai sentito partire alcuna ventola (come ho letto in alcune recensioni). Sarà che non uso il computer per gaming e che ho già un supporto con ventole per il piccolo laptop, ma anche questa cosa per me comunque non è un problema.

Per il momento non ho molto altro da aggiungere.
Aggiornerò magari la recensione in futuro; vorrei anche provare la docking station con un dac esterno o con una interfaccia audio.",0,

La potencia es 180W es suficiente. la tension en mi caso es 19,5V y el amperaje 9,23A. Según la placa de características de mi portátil la tensión era de 19,5 V y 3.3A con lo cual iba sobrado con 130W. Pero resulta que luego vi que la placa es errónea ya que mi portátil consume en puntas de procesador y grafica y cuando se conecta una pantalla supera esa potencia.

After some reading about USB-C and its bandwidth, it seems as though it cannot handle the bandwidth for 3 HD monitors.
To overcome this, i have 2 monitors plugged in to the docking station and 1 plugged in to the HDMI port on the laptop; not ideal, but i get the outcome i require.

If you want to drive 3 HD monitors, buy the thunder bolt version of this docking station as the USB-C version does not have the bandwidth.",11,

When I did open the box, the poorly sealed bags and thin layer of dirt (inside and out) made me second guess now ""new"" my new dock was.

After opening a bag, I was convinced --- that was (at best) a refurbished product.
I don't have anything against a refurbished product, but I like to know what I'm buying when I click the order button. Especially when I'm setting it up as a gift for someone.

Unfortunately, there are some stubborn oil/dirt marks on the case, and I feel like the product was not correctly advertised/labeled.

It failed (same problem) in the same time frame. I had bought a tech service plan this time but they denied coverage saying it was under warranty with Dell. Dell has no record of the purchase so I’m out that money and a dock. Frustrated, I decided to go directly to Dell and get a new one. Ordered but it would be 3 months before I could get it. So reluctantly I bought a third from Amazon because I needed it for working. It arrived…none of the USB ports work.

I think the design is flawed and is not geared towards business use. On previous docking stations, Dell has provided many monitor options but also multiple connections. DVI is not even an option now and on previous docks, these provided the best image. Dell should pick at least 1 monitor connector and have 2 of them. I haven't used just a single monitor in over 10 years. 2 of my monitors are exactly the same and i would like to use the same type of cable and connectors. The on/off works for off consistenly but randomly works for on. The USB devices are usually recognized but occasionally they are lost and when this happens, you must reboot several times and move the devices to other ports, repeatedly. Eventually the device will be known.

Typical complaints run along the lines of:

1. Windows has forgotten my monitor arrangement.
2. My external monitors don't work (MST hub sometimes flakes when using DisplayPort).
3. My mouse and keyboard don't work (dock's USB ports).

We're doing nothing special with monitors: most are standard 1920x1080 flat panels with DisplayPort or HDMI inputs. I don't believe these problems arise simply from user error, and that they are intrinsic to the dock and its operation with Windows.

I give the dock two stars because Dell at least issues frequent driver updates that may resolve problems, but I'm deducting a star because Dell phone support was unfamiliar with the WD15 when I called about it in June of 2016. That might've changed by now.",2,

I do wish that I could use my laptop screen as a 3rd monitor. When I open the lid, the resolution gets all weird on one of my two monitors and the other turns black.
When I install the audio drivers for the WD15, there is a popping sound at the end of every sound clip. Uninstalling the drivers and using the native MS drivers resolved that issue.

 I am reviewing this after about 2.5 months of using this product. It worked fine so far. Past 2 weeks I am having issue with charging. First it stopped working intermittently. But now as soon as I put it in laptop its blue light on cable stops. But when I take it out it blue charging light on cable lights up. I replaced while new battery in laptop thinking battery gone dead. But even with new battery it is same behaviour.
I bought new charger from bestbuy and used with my new as well as old battery and it works fine. That confirms it is an issue with this charger.
I want my money back for this unreliable item.

Update - 10-20-2020
After I reached out to the seller ""IT Parts Now"" whome I purchased this item they replied within 1hr and issue full refund in 48hours.
The item was defective but they really show great customer service. I hate to say but Amazon did not make easy for me to find and reaching out to seller. When I looked for seller by searching product it shows on the top ""last purchased date"" but that does not indicate if the seller is same or different. Hence you end up reaching out to wrong seller. When they can show last purchased date for the item can't they add one more details ""same or different seller"" ?

Anyway, not only for this but for many other electronic items I found shop around and you will find many better place. I found great deal on walmart where seller gives 2year warranty on product. I would never buy such items on amazon that I had to deal with seller myself after 30 day closing window.",1,

Frustrated at the thought that my cord needs replaced, I rushed to RadioShack as fast as I could to replace it. Buying my new $65 charging kit with multiple heads, I soon found out it didn't give off enough power to charge it. Even more frustrated now, I asked my tech friend to direct me to what kind I needed, he directed me and found the exact same cord that I had for a decent price on Amazon. Without hesitation, I bought it! The charger was sent in a fast paced delivery and was exactly the same as the one I had previously. Perfect!

The product itself is a 3 prong charger with wraps for when you are done using it and want to put it away neatly. The charger comes into two breakdown pieces that you can remove. One of the wraps is on the battery itself and wraps the port for the laptop. The other wrap is for the cord that plugs into the wall. Easy to use and put away when needed.

Altogether, if you need a computer charging cord for your Dell XPS like I did, then this is your baby. Satisfied and would recommend.

Their shipping date was way off the estimated time of arrival and I was happy that it was early but I would've liked a more accurate estimation. The charger has it's polarity shown a strange way it while it is genuine Dell seemingly it certainly wasn't the OEM that came with my Latitude e6540.

EDIT: 3/24 I bought this charger a few months ago and I figured it would last but a portion of the charger is already broken. Fortunately my dog chewed through the opposite portion on my last charger which is why i bought this one in the first place but I had to literally salvage my old charger to make this charger continue working.

More in detail: The charger when plugged into the wall stopped actually providing power and I was really confused when my laptop almost died in the middle of some school work so I looked and it was plugged in. I figured maybe the charger had overheated or something which would still be terrible but it was cold as the tile floor so it wasn't even running. The blue light on the charger wasn't running either so it wasn't even receiving power. I tried to maybe unplug it and replug it in and it lit up for a couple seconds then the light went dead again whether it was plugged into my computer or not so it wasn't pulling a constant current. I took the old cord form the wall to the adapter from my previous charger and changed it out with the one from this charger and it started working again so I guess the cord from the wall to adapter just broke but within a couple months of use just simply breaking one day when it gets plugged in is pretty disappointed. I will follow up with an update once I contact the seller because it said these things were under a warranty when I bought it and I have screenshot of that. (side note if anyone thinks maybe my dog had chewed on this one as well I specifically checked the whole cord and it is pristine on the outside so it couldn't have been that also by the point I got the new charger she had been trained well enough not to chew on things anymore). @Adeptshop if you want to comment here feel free I will contact you within the next few days but I am super busy tomorrow!",0,

So instead of spending the $89.99 Dell charges on their site I decided it time to buy a new one on Amazon at less than half the price. Unfortunately that was an expensive mistake. The ""new"" charger I got sparked at the outlet end every time I plugged it in. I tried different outlets in different houses and tried surge protectors, but it didn't solve the problem. I was dumb and didn't return it (and still used it) and before I knew it I was outside of the return window. About 2 months after I purchased it my motherboard died. It may or may not be related, but worth mentioning. I contacted Dell about their warranty (on the charger) and they said they will only honor warranties when products are purchased directly through their site. Further upon inspection, the charger started to fray on the laptop end as well, again after only 2 months. Save your money and buy directly from Dell and avoid the costly mistake I made as I am now out a laptop and a charger. Not worth the initial savings or hassle it has caused.

For now, the adapter sits in my office closet in the very nice 'velvet' carrying bag, and I'll hold on to it for future use. The adapter was received in a timely manner from the seller, and I would seriously consider ordering from them again.",0,

I can't say it's a 100% fake without tearing it apart but I'll let you decide.

In my pictures you can see the OEM Dell Charger on the right (Model Number: DA130PE1-00 / PN: JU012) and you can the fake unit on the left that has the same model and part marking.

Note the total cheap looking LED sticking out of the unit instead of the smooth recessed LED that is on Dell 90w adapters (DP/N: YD9W8)

When I plug it in the green light lasts for exactly 2 seconds and then fades out. I am very frustrated and it is extremely inconvenient because I have numerous work related projects I am in the middle of and now. I 100% regret buying this product and would not recommend buying it.

Even with smart power ports that are part of the newer USB-C spec, powering with at more than double the intended wattage brick is not a good idea. This 65watt brick was a perfect match for the one that came with my new Dell laptop but got left in a hotel in frantic pack-out to catch an early flight home.

I wanted something attractive on the desks yet with decent sound. These did the job. They're very stylish, and the sound quality is better than what you would expect from some el cheapo desktop speakers. The bass is lacking, but that's to be expected from desktop computer speakers. These are great for playing music at your desk (albeit with not much bass), they're sufficiently loud, they look good and they don't require a big power brick as they are powered via USB port.

I do have one small complaint. Actually it's not a complaint but a ""I feel so stupid"" moment. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why I was getting now sound from the speakers. I mean how hard can it be to hook up speakers. I though maybe the USB port wasn't powering the speakers. So I tried on another computer, same thing. I looked for a power button, or volume knob on the speakers to no avail.

After nearly giving up and returning the speakers, I realized that there is a power, and volume knob. Look at the photo of the speaker. The top is completely flat. The volume knob is actually on top of the speakers flat/flush. The knob is not labeled and because it's so flat against the surface I never noticed it. I know I sound like and idiot but you'll see what I mean when you buy them. So once I figured out where the power and volume know was, I actually liked them more, it keeps the speakers looking sexy. No unsightly knobs poking out of the front.",25,

We listen to news radio and/or music depending on the time of day. We also use Skype for video calls. At the price one can't go far wrong but a comparison seemed fun. Here's what I found:

- The Dell AX210 speakers are, well, tinny. They get the message across and spoken words are not lost. News radio is OK but music lacks tone. For music, there's almost no bass, midrange is muddy and treble is shrill. The good news, however, is that the volume can be set in a seemingly infinite range between 0 and, well, whatever they will handle. This may be because there is a 3.5mm green sound card connector in addition to the USB connector.

- The Logitech S150 speakers sound much better, full stop. They are more dynamic, warmer, better balanced and much more clear, pleasant and musical. But they are difficult to modulate just off silent, no matter what settings we try (speaker buttons, control panel sound controls, keyboard controls, web volume controls, etc.). So sometimes they get turned off because the lowest setting is still too much. Perhaps this is because they have a USB connection only.

They're all fine for the price! Next time out I will spend a few more dollars for better quality sound out of speakers that also can be controlled easily.",5,

It is not extremely loud, but meets the needs for a medium sized room.

It is not perfect sound with limited bass, as is expected for the price and size.

First time operators should know that the volume control is on top of one of the speakers and if you do not turn it on and up, you will not get sound. It is hard to see, if you are not aware of it.",12,

Both orders sounded okay. Nothing special, but definitely usable. You get what you pay for here. The first of them however, quickly developed a buzzing and popping noise whenever they were powered on. Unusable. I quickly returned them and got my money back. This works itself out though, now I've got just the one for myself, just as I intended.

That went downhill fast. I haven't had the second pair plugged in for 24 hours yet and they have already developed the same feedback issues. It really isn't worth my time to even return these anymore.

I haven't had these speakers a month yet (the pair I didn't return), and they continue to get worse. Sometimes you can't use them at all, even through the noise. Look elsewhere. Stay away from these speakers.

Riehl,5.0,2020-08-22 00:00:00,美國,,"I was hesitant to buy this speaker for my Dell U2415 monitor based on so many reviews that said it didn't work as advertised (i.e. that it needed both a USB connection for power as well as an aux cable for the sound signal ""THAT ISN'T EVEN INCLUDED!!!). Some folks even said that it didn't work with both a USB and aux cable connected.
But I wanted a speaker that wouldn't take up any space on my desk and I don't need disco club volume nor thumping base, so I went for it. I figured worst case I'd need to use an aux cable (or worst worst-case it wouldn't work for me at all and I have to return it, but hey, returning stuff is one of Amazon's strengths, right?)
So anyway it delivered next day after ordering (the joys of living in a metropolitan area!), I pulled it out of the box and connected the speaker's USB cable into one of the monitor's USB hub outlets and voila, sound was coming out of the speaker even before Skype and all of the other annoying Microsoft bloat-ware had finished starting up after I powered my computer on. Absolutely no setup of any sort required from me on the computer side of things. See the attached picture to this review for how the computer shows the speaker in the audio output section after all is said and done. So easy and I'm running Windows 8 on this machine, for Pete's Sake!

Which leads me to wonder; do people not realize that if you plug this speaker's USB plug into one of the monitor's USB ports that the monitor itself has to ALSO be connected to the computer independently via its own USB cord?
Even if you don't have your monitor hub connected (or don't have a monitor hub at all), the attached USB plug on the speaker has quite a long cord so hypothetically it would easily plug directly into the computer itself. I haven't tried that, but am absolutely confident it would work just fine. Even better, theoretically, since plugging the speaker into the monitor USB port instead of the computer's means the audio has the extra complexity of going through the USB hub in the monitor. Not that I've noticed any problems at all with that but I suppose if you were doing high data-rate transfers through the hub the sound could take a hit because of it.

Sound is perfectly fine, even great, for the size and price of this thing. Again, I don't need disco club volume nor thumping base nor battlefield realistic sound for my application so you may feel differently.
Actually I had to lower the speaker, computer, and music app volumes all down to the lower ends of their respective sliders while playing some test tracks since my kid's bedroom is right next to my ""office"" and the sound output was pretty significant when I first plugged it in.

My U2415 has two slots in the bottom of it that were covered up with some glorified tape pieces. Once I pulled the tape off with a mini-screwdriver the two tabs on top of the speaker slotted right into the monitor slots and it looks just like one of the photos Amazon has posted for this item.

If you go to Dell's page for this speaker, click on the ""Tech Specs"" tab, and scroll down to ""Compatibility"" you'll see a long list of Dell monitors this speaker is designed to work with. I'd guesstimate 2 out of 3 or maybe even 4 out of 5 in that list don't need the included monitor stand mount (the list differentiates which do or don't). Mine was one of those that don't so I can't speak to people's issues with the monitor stand mount, but I'm wondering if their monitor is even on that list at all.",26,樣式: 標準

Got this for my moms computer, she is hearing impaired now. She had a set of Bose speakers that failed and the price to buy new ones is practically obscene now, and I felt those were way over priced to begin with.
She has a Dell home computer, and I wanted her to have something that would not take up any desk space, and that would install below the monitor easily. She's had this for over 4 months now and it is still going strong. Sound quality is good, crystal clear but base is kind of weak. I have these hooked up to a USB instead of a 3.5mm output, that way there is only one volume control, she would sometimes turn the volume down from the computer and wonder why she couldn't get any volume with the speakers control... problem solved. Also, this way I don't need a seperate power source, there's way too many wires below the computer desk already.
I paid $35.99 for these at the time, after installing and hearing them, I really don't think these are worth more that about $25 - $30. I also purchased a warranty on these, Bose wanted almost as much to fix as it would cost to replace them. And before these I went through 3 other pairs of computer speakers, all of them had volume control knob issues. And having sold electronics for years, back it the days when they were made in Japan, even then volume controls failing was a common issue on small audio devices, but now it seems even worse.
I do recommend this speaker, and my Mom seems happy with the overall performance of it, and I would most definitely buy again. I give it 4 stars instead of 5, because it is not price competitive, and I am paying for the Dell name.
I hope this helped with your decision.",14,樣式: 標準

I use mostly Dell products so this speaker seemed to fit in great. The mounting design is simple but great - just a spring-tension clamp mount adapter that grabs onto the neck of the Dell monitor stand and has a little rubber piece for grip and tension. The clamp will only fit on a certain Dell monitor stand which is the very common single neck found on probably 2/3rds of Dell monitors. The monitor I was using is one of the Dell gaming monitors that has a slightly different neck in the stand which was too wide to use this mounting clamp.

Luckily I had multiple Dell stands and they are (for the most part) all interchangeable for which I swapped stands and the mount fit like a champ.

I attach my laptop through a dock when I am at my desk, and I wanted a clutter-free speaker that was compatible with my Dell external monitor. So I'm not doing any gaming or listening to high-fidelity music, but I do have times when I have to play very low-quality audio and video recordings and make out what is being said, and my Dell laptop speakers are insufficient for that.

This replaced a monitor-soundbar setup I'd had since 2015. The sound quality here is MUCH better than it was with that older soundbar, and this speaker also seems to get louder and stay clearer at the louder range. I haven't tested that much yet, but it is important when I am listening to very soft recordings that I have to turn way up to hear. Obviously, for $30 you are not going to get world-class audio. But after reading some of the reviews, I was more than pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound coming out of these for a business computer.

As for connecting the sound, as others have mentioned, the only input is a USB cable. I prefer to plug the USB cable directly into one of the USB ports on my monitor, to minimize cable clutter. (I mounted the bar fairly high on the monitor pedestal so you cannot see the cable running from behind the speaker into the monitor when sitting at my desk). I've tried several combinations and unfortunately my monitor does not seem to receive/pass through audio using either a DisplayPort or HDMI cable. So the two options are either (1) plug the speaker's USB cable directly into your computer, or (2) run a USB A-B cable from your computer to the monitor. That USB cable is what carries the sound and allows the monitor to output sound through it's own USB cable. I chose to run a separate cable because I did not have any vacant USB ports on my dock. By running a single USB cable to my monitor, I can have use of 4 USB ports on my monitor for other devices, essentially turning my monitor into a USB hub. So in addition to this soundbar, I now plug my external webcam into a port on my monitor, and also plug my diaphragm microphone into the monitor on the rare occasions I use it, but once the monitor is connected to the computer by USB, you should be able to run most USB devices through it.",8,樣式: 標準

The bedside computer is now a Intel NUC which is attached to a 22 inch Dell monitor which I pulled off of another system that now has a new monitor on it. I wanted to try a USB speaker solution rather than the older analog jack type speakers. After a bit of research I settled on the Dell AC511M soundbar because it attaches to the base of most current Dell monitors in the class of my aforementioned unit. As well, as long as the USB hub built into the monitor is plugged into the computer -- the soundbar can be plugged directly into the monitor. The audio from the soundbar is clear, crisp and has a decent amount of bass to it for it's size. Of course it's not going to beat a speaker system which has a sub woofer -- but it does run circles around my old laptop's speakers. There is one major issue which caused me to knock off one star. Because of the way this USB sound bar operates -- it cannot be controlled by Realtek software/drivers. Only basic Windows volume up/down functionality works. Which, this means that software such as the Realtek Audio Console absolutely will not work in terms of equalization controls because the sound bar is not seen by it. What's worse -- I could not find any solution either on Realtek's or Dell's websites that could resolve the issue. In the end I had to go with a third party solution I found on Sourceforge that does work. I don't understand why this is like this because USB speakers have been out for years now and I cannot believe that Realtek hasn't done something about this issue. Particularly, since Realtek plays such a major role when it comes to audio systems for computers.

Check the compatible Dell monitor stands but it attached with ease to mine.

Sounds: Voices are loud and clear for calls. The soundbar has volume adjust buttons which increase or decrease the Windows volume control. The sound is a bit deeper and richer than you get from typical ""tinny"" sounding PC speakers. I have not run into any issues with audio.

Mic: This unit has an integrated far-field microphone. I typically sit 2-4 feet from the microphone and it picks my voice up well. Feedback has been that I sound clear on calls. There is a mute button on the soundbar, in addition to buttons for answer and hang-up, which could be handy in certain circumstances. The microphone on this soundbar is far better than the integrated mic on my USB camera. However, I would say it's generally of average sound capture quality. I have had no issues with it and it is sufficient for hours of daily conference calls.

I have attached pictures of the front view under monitor and the rear view of the mounting adapter.

I purchased this because it had an integrated microphone. I believe that is the key feature to choose this soundbar over all other alternatives available.

- Plug and Play. Computer recognized and loaded drivers (used computer for USB power)

- Mount is very solid on the stand, although I was worried is would snap before I got it mounted to my Dell U2520D stock stand. The bracket barely fit, but it did not break.

I knew this was compatible with my monitor because I could feel little tabs that peeled off on the bottom of the monitor that exposed the mounting holes for the speaker, very straightforward.

It is sensitive to the movement of your finger. There is no need to open a volume control window by a separate action. The window opens automatically when you touch the control disk.

However, don't move away from this awesome speaker just because your monitor is incompatible with the mount. You can just use 3M Command tape to attach it to the bottom of your monitor like how I did in the picture.

This speaker is for someone who doesn't want to wear headset for conference call. The echo cancellation works great as long as you keep speaker volume in reasonable level. I found echo cancellation works better if you just keep the microphone always on rather than turning it on only when you want to speak.

It is a 5W speaker and music performance is decent, but it won't satisfy you if you compare it with proper PC speaker like Bose. To me, it sounds great and I enjoy listening music from it.

Meaning that it has a built-in DAC, whereas there are speakers that are powered by USB for power only and still use the analog line-in for sound.

The one drawback is that the volume control is digital. The knob on the right side of the speaker doesn't actually change the volume on the speaker itself. It tells windows to change the volume level digitally. It's not a potentiometer that changes the volume of the speakers. Why is this a drawback? So if you're not playing anything all you hear is the hiss of white noise which means the gain is turned all the way up amplifying the noise.

Also, there is no physical power button. So if you have this plugged into a matching Dell monitor it only turns off when you turn off the power on the monitor and the integrated USB hub is powered down as well.

In short, you can't adjust the actual gain of the speaker and you hear white noise all the time when nothing is being played and you can't turn it off to avoid hearing the noise.

As for sound. It's really flat, the

It's ok for $34.98. Is it the best speaker you can get? Probably not, but it doesn't take up desk space and it's plug and play. I'm not sure the AE515M is any better besides some integrated buttons for Skype and a built-in microphone.",10,樣式: 標準

Everything was great, sound was great (for an inexpensive monitor sound bar), it mounted easily... Then I went to turn it off and realized there is no ""off"" switch. My old Dell speaker bar would turn off via the volume control knob. Not this one. You can hear the hiss of white noise, and there is NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF. I also thought maybe I could do it via the windows audio controls. Nope. So, if you like to work in a quiet space like I do, this sound bar is a terrible option.

I was expecting much worse sound after reading the reviews here, but it's surprisingly good for a small soundbar. If you're disappointed in the sound quality, you have unrealistic expectations, or a poor grasp of physics. Perfectly adequate for listening to music while working, and great volume. At 100 volume (Windows 10 volume slider, via USB audio connection) I didn't hear any distortion, though it's way, way too loud to be pleasant. 30 is about right.

All the wiring can be out of sight, this little speaker / monitor setup is great for smaller desks and tight places. The design is space-saving and very functional - I love having a master PHYSICAL volume knob for my PC audio.

Overall it's a great product - if you're buying it and expecting MEGA BASS and ear-drum destroying loudness, then you're setting yourself up for disappointment. It is strictly a business tool meant to aid in teleconferencing (Skype and what not) and meant to add decent PC audio to your otherwise speaker-less Dell monitor without complicated wiring or extra bulk. Great for watching YouTube videos or listening to background music while working.

People I talk to think I'm wearing a headset. It doesn't pick up fan noise of my laptop which is directly underneath it. My voice is picked up clearly when I talk. There is absolutely no echo feedback.

This thing is great. What a fantastic buy. I'm super happy with it for my meetings and the quality is perfect.

I'm not using this to play music or videos. I only use it for conference calls and basic Windows sounds.
